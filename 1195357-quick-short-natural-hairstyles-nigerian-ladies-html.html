Besides, the curls will style themselves, and you will not have to worry about them all the time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/aa6dc6fa8a58fc07.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fresh ideas of weave and braided hairstyles</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4180644a31786d29.jpeg><h3>2. Natural Mohawk style</h3><p class=align-left>This option is especially for those women who are bold, brave and not afraid of shaving off their hair almost completely, leaving a courageous Mohawk in the middle. To rock this hairstyle, you have to know for sure that extra short options suit you and emphasize on your face.</p><p class=align-left>The most awesome thing about this kind of hair choice is that you will not even have to comb your hair most of the time – only the very top of it. The only thing you need to remember is to keep the hair moisturized and hydrated, for it to stay healthy. Otherwise, you will not have to sacrifice a lot of time to styling it and making it look perfect because it already does.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/aa6dc6fa8a58fc07.jpeg><h3>3. Short hairstyle with shaved offsides</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the basic hairstyles, but nonetheless, it is really charming and attractive. The sweet curls are mixed with the rebellious shaved offsides, and you will look quite mysterious with this hair choice. In terms of caring for this kind of hairstyle, you have to remember that washing it too much will not do any good to your natural curls.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a5d742ac62f785c2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Make a statement with these 15 lovely short natural hairstyles</span></p></a><p class=align-left>So, in case you go for it, you may go for two-three day periods of time without washing it, but you will need to make sure it stays moisturized all the time. And of course, using natural oils is very healthy for the hair and will do wonders for it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt539sfc3ni77.jpeg><h3>4. Short natural tapered haircut</h3><p class=align-left>If you want to create an unforgettable messy hairstyle that will make you look like a fun-loving person, you should certainly pick this one. The styling tools will not be needed for your desired look, and if you are resisting the temptation to get hair straighteners or heated tools, you totally should not – the curls are extremely charming and beautiful as they are. If you already have damaged or dry hair, or problems from many years of using hair extensions, the heated tools will not help your locks, only hurt them. The point of this hairstyle is giving your hair a well-deserved break.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/bb3da7613c513996.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 short and protective natural hairstyles for beautiful African women</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkytkqr0a1a9eco.jpeg><h3>5. Teeny-weeny afro hairstyle</h3><p class=align-left>The ultra-short afro is an item as well. If you want a hairstyle that will not get in your way and bother you, and if you are courageous enough to adopt an extra-short hairstyle, then you should definitely choose this option.</p><p class=align-left>This is one of the freshest and cool looks of the year, and your short haircut will give you the great opportunity to show your best accessories, like earrings and ear piercings, as well as the stunning makeup.</p><p class=align-left>Teeny-weeny afro does not need a lot of maintenance and styling – in fact, it requires the bare minimum of it. This hairstyle will give you plenty of time for your eyebrows and makeup routine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a5d742ac62f785c2.jpeg><h3>6.

There will not be a lot of hair for playing around, and your chosen color will have to work out nicely together with your skin tone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt408i31qvqtj.jpeg><h3>7. Simple natural style</h3><p class=align-left>When you had your hair washed, you can play around with different solutions, techniques, and ideas. For instance, when your hair is in wet stages rather than already fully dried, it is much easier to operate with it. You will be able to move your locks, twist them, make braids and curl them into various styles.</p><p class=align-left>There are so many ways to style your natural hair, and sometimes you may not notice that, but it is a fact. Experimenting with twists and curls when the hair is still wet will give you the most original results that you would have never thought of. This particular hairstyle is really classy, nostalgic and reminds of old times, so it would be perfect for vintage lovers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4a3496fba5b16c31.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing big twist hairstyles for the natural hair enthusiasts</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/bb3da7613c513996.jpeg><h3>8. Mohawk with fade</h3><p class=align-left>The change from the regular Mohawk hairstyle will be very subtle, but it will surely add some originality and confidence. Your curly Mohawk will still be on top, but the undercut will go through minor changes - a design will be shaved on it to add more excitement to the old classic hairstyle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt70v78uf29pm.jpeg><h3>9. Long pixie haircut</h3><p class=align-left>This hairstyle has been rocked for a while by the music superstar Rihanna, and she looked just gorgeous. She was alternating between the regular pixie cut that you usually see around, which is completely straight, and the pixie haircut consisting of the natural curls, which you can see right here.</p><p class=align-left>They are both lovely, but the natural pixie cut is less common, therefore giving you a chance to make it your own. You can achieve a look like this if you refuse the extensions for a while and let your hair flow in its natural way. Perhaps, you would like to look like a celebrity? Then it is time for you to try out your own pixie cut.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt32skuum5gqg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 natural hairstyles that you can wear every day</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt33qm0fgg98vg.jpeg><h3>10. Short natural hairstyle with colored tips</h3><p class=align-left>Coloring your hair in different original shades is really common nowadays, simply because the women know so many multicolored options to choose for their hair to make it look like no one else’s. In case your hair has been damaged because of constant coloring and drying out, you should make certain that you use the right oils and other means of treatment to keep it healthy and hydrated.</p><p class=align-left>Before washing your hair, you should add some oil treatment, and then leave it like this for about half an hour before you start washing it out. Once you have washed your hair, you should dry it with the towel (using the blow dryer would not be helpful in this situation), then add some conditioner, and style your hair before it is fully dried.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/3782c8e0ee100a96.jpeg><h3>11. Fauxhawk made of coils</h3><p class=align-left>Not having hair extensions in your hair really has a huge amount of benefits.

Tapered haircut</h3><p class=align-left>This is a hairstyle which is majorly inspired by the biggest Hollywood celebrities. For example, the sister of music queen Beyonce, Solange Knowles, used to have a long weave, but when she shaved her head, she decided just to go for a natural look and did not regret growing out her curls. Therefore, this beautiful hairstyle emerged.</p><p class=align-left>The whole appeal of it is in how simple and adorable it is, and this is why it is on the list of our recommendations. In case you have had long locks for a while, and your heart is open for a change, maybe this is your look that you should try out. By the way, you can choose whether to dye your hair or not – both options would look stunning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1i6ibct538ko.jpeg><h3>18. A little pop of blonde</h3><p class=align-left>Here we have one of these hairstyles which can definitely attract everyone’s attention because of its unusual nature. This haircut reminds of some science fiction movie characters, with its futuristic geometric vibe. And the appeal of this style lies in its uniqueness. If you are not fully ready to go for an absolute blonde dye, you can just dye a little tip of your hair blonde, leave the other hair of your natural color, and shave off the sides, also adding some curious designs on the bottom. You should feel free to play with different colors – caramel, copper, and grey, which were already mentioned on our list. Feel free to make this haircut truly your own.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt67batah4e17.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best short natural hairstyles for beautiful Nigerian women in 2018</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Latest weavon hairstyles to fix in 2018</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt6hro6430178.jpeg><h3>19. Ultra-short style for rebellious and hardworking ladies</h3><p class=align-left>If you want to leave just a thin line of curls on your head, you can play with it and make it bolder than just that. This said, just a simple shaved-off straight line can become the great design and make a difference in your entire look. This addition is really small, but it will create an unforgettable image that everyone will remember you for, and transform yourself into a fierce and confident lady. This little touch will change your hairstyle from a generic short hair to something very playful and funky. By the way, you can also try a similar haircut, but with a chop instead of curls – this one was worn by many famous celebrities, notably Raven Symone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1ds76hfn8at8.jpeg><h3>20.
