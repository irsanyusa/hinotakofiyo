We&nbsp;have these stereotypes in&nbsp;our minds thanks to&nbsp;movies and popular literature. They’re responsible for creating a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;myths about the Middle Ages that often have nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with what that time period actually looked like. Don’t forget that this <a href=# title=historical data-link=tag>historical</a> period lasted from the fifth to&nbsp;the fifteenth century, and many things changed beyond recognition during this long stretch of&nbsp;time.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have reviewed the biggest complaints historians have about popular movies set in&nbsp;this time period and are eager to&nbsp;tell you which myths about the Middle Ages we&nbsp;shouldn’t believe.</p><p><h2>Dirty people</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de1/5e8/5374215a48860f03e1db58e176.jpg><p>Thanks to&nbsp;movies, many people imagine those that lived in&nbsp;the Middle Ages as&nbsp;being very dirty. They didn’t <a href=#>bathe</a> more than once a&nbsp;year, they looked terrible&nbsp;— and they smelled even worse. However, this isn’t true. There were public saunas that were really popular among the common folk. People went there to&nbsp;take baths and communicate. The city of&nbsp;Bath in&nbsp;Great Britain became famous in&nbsp;the Middle Ages thanks to&nbsp;its hot springs. But while wealthy people could afford actual baths, poor people washed themselves with wet cloths.</p><p>Bad body odor was unacceptable. It&nbsp;was associated with sin, so&nbsp;most people, no&nbsp;matter how wealthy they were, tried to&nbsp;smell as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;possible.</p><p><h2>Illiterate people</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/99e/a29/3381f654289581117f7a01d7a1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the Middle Ages, people <a href=#>weren’t</a> as&nbsp;uninformed as&nbsp;we&nbsp;think. Churches were not places where dark superstitions were spread. Instead, they were actually places that contained <a href=#>knowledge</a>. In&nbsp;fact, many European universities were established at&nbsp;that time.</p><p>Most people were aware that the Earth was <a href=#>round</a>, and the Church didn’t say otherwise.</p><p><h2>Noble knights</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/571/d23/2fa48653e09b2dd14c10f42e8a.jpg><p>A&nbsp;knight is&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;bravery, honor, and justice. A&nbsp;true warrior protects the weak and punishes bad people. But not all of&nbsp;the medieval warriors were good.</p><p>Most knights were men that were bursting with energy. And when they weren’t fighting wars, they were <a href=#>terrorizing</a> the public. In&nbsp;the eleventh century, lords started to&nbsp;use these warriors to&nbsp;keep the people under control, which ultimately led to&nbsp;destroyed villages. According to&nbsp;one version of&nbsp;the story, crusades were <a href=#>organized</a> to&nbsp;get these young men away from the homelands.</p><p><h2>Nothing but lords and peasants</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/38d/812/9f7e065cafb4f9915690de05f1.jpg><p>The social stratification in&nbsp;the Middle Ages was far more <a href=#>complex</a> than we&nbsp;think. There weren’t only lords and peasants. Those that we&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;as&nbsp;peasants could’ve been people working on&nbsp;the lands that belonged to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lord or&nbsp;free people that owned their own lands or&nbsp;had a&nbsp;business. In&nbsp;small towns, several rich families could basically control the entire place.</p><p>Servants in&nbsp;castles could also be&nbsp;nobles. There was a&nbsp;custom of&nbsp;lords sending their sons to&nbsp;a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;relatives to&nbsp;serve there. They could also become <a href=#>pages</a>. They didn’t get any money for this work but their position was higher than that of&nbsp;ordinary people. Most of&nbsp;the servants were male.</p><p><h2>Medieval housewives</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df5/4f1/66cabf5a768b98a02fed403145.jpg><p>The lives of&nbsp;women in&nbsp;the Middle Ages were not as&nbsp;grim and <a href=#>dark</a> as&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems. Many women didn’t have to&nbsp;spend the entire day at&nbsp;home. They could work, help their husband, or&nbsp;work at&nbsp;any guild. Sometimes, women needed their husband’s permission to&nbsp;work somewhere.</p><p>The women that acquired good skills could <a href=#>teach</a> beginners, even men, so&nbsp;many people did their house chores only when they weren’t working. And cooking wasn’t always necessary: there were plenty of&nbsp;<a href=#>vendors</a> that sold cooked food in&nbsp;major urban areas.</p><p>Widowed women could also <a href=#>inherit</a> businesses from their late husbands.</p><p><h2>Beautiful princesses</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/71c/2d1/29ff90515db289ae1032154a83.jpg><p>Beautiful women would let their <a href=#>hair</a> down in&nbsp;the Middle Ages but this was done primarily by&nbsp;frivolous women. A&nbsp;well-mannered woman that was no&nbsp;longer a&nbsp;child was supposed to&nbsp;cover her hair. This was also true for noblewomen and common folk.</p><p>Good manners were very appreciated back then. In&nbsp;fact, violating proper <a href=# title=etiquette data-link=tag>etiquette</a> could ruin the life of&nbsp;not only the lady herself but also her entire family. Talking to&nbsp;strangers was unacceptable. Kissing a&nbsp;man, even on&nbsp;the cheek, that wasn’t her husband or&nbsp;a&nbsp;blood relative was a&nbsp;terrible violation. And the tradition of&nbsp;kissing women’s hands appeared only in&nbsp;the <a href=#>eighteenth century</a>.</p><p><h2>Terrible manners</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f1/af1/43eebf55b49f499774b3e46685.jpg><p>The feasts of&nbsp;aristocrats and ordinary people didn’t look like horror movie scenes where everyone just grabbed the food with their hands, eating as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;they could, snorting, and throwing pieces under the table. There was an&nbsp;<a href=#>etiquette</a> that regulated the way people ate. Most people ate with knives and spoons. They also used tablecloths.</p><p>People <a href=#>used</a> their personal knives that they’d bring with them as&nbsp;guests. They never ate off the knives but would pick a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;food off of&nbsp;it&nbsp;with their fingers and put it&nbsp;into their mouths. People weren’t allowed to&nbsp;put their elbows on&nbsp;the table or&nbsp;put too much food in&nbsp;their mouths. They couldn’t touch the salt with their fingers. The bread was cut, not just torn into pieces. Napkins were also used.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that potatoes and <a href=#>turkey</a>, which have become popular in&nbsp;films, actually appeared only in&nbsp;the sixteenth century.</p><p><h2>Evil wizards and witches</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/96c/b41/191b375caf88bc1f86f5ec9264.jpg><p>Witches weren’t <a href=#>hunted</a> as&nbsp;fiercely as&nbsp;we&nbsp;assume. The church wasn’t interested in&nbsp;them until the time between the thirteenth and fifteenth century and didn’t terrorize them everywhere. In&nbsp;fact, people approached witches for help.</p><p><h2>Cavalries</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/874/4c3/92040851bca665ea6f9a4700de.jpg><p>It&nbsp;looks <a href=#>spectacular</a> when a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;heavily-armored knights on&nbsp;their horses smash into an&nbsp;army of&nbsp;enemies. Despite this, warriors often got off their horses in&nbsp;battles because it&nbsp;was more effective. Horses were great during the initial portion of&nbsp;a&nbsp;siege and to&nbsp;pull canons, wagons, and supplies, but they weren’t so&nbsp;effective against a&nbsp;well-trained infantry.</p><p><h2>Battles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/d86/dfe/f620e4576aa87f9b7fad4ec6da.jpeg><p>Military commanders cared about the motivation of&nbsp;their warriors but the epic speeches were <a href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;the camp before going into battle. It&nbsp;wasn’t very smart to&nbsp;walk around screaming on&nbsp;the battlefield because it&nbsp;would make you a&nbsp;good target for the archers. Besides, most of&nbsp;your warriors wouldn’t hear a&nbsp;word you said anyway.</p><p>To&nbsp;make the battle scenes easier to&nbsp;watch, warriors look very different in&nbsp;films. Some can be&nbsp;seen wearing shiny armor and others don old rags and camouflage gear. But it&nbsp;wasn’t as&nbsp;obvious in&nbsp;real life. For example, Braveheart showed the Scottish warriors with blue <a href=#>lines</a> on&nbsp;their faces. But in&nbsp;reality, this custom wouldn’t be&nbsp;popular for another 1,000 years after the time the events took place.</p><p><h2>Dirty streets, chickens, and pigs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/93d/2ee/fed2ce56a79dc5f7efb817dd72.jpg><p>Movies show the cities of&nbsp;the Middle Ages in&nbsp;very grim colors with scenes full of&nbsp;dirt and pigs and chickens running around. But it&nbsp;wasn’t as&nbsp;bad in&nbsp;reality. There were strict laws that <a href=#>made</a> people take care of&nbsp;the area around their houses. They had to&nbsp;clean the streets and people were fined for littering.</p><p>People weren’t allowed to&nbsp;let their animals roam free in&nbsp;the streets. They were <a href=#>fined</a> for that.</p><p><h2>Boring clothes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/459/0df/c0ad135763a03cceba1b5d932e.jpg><p>We’re used to&nbsp;seeing people from the Middle Ages in&nbsp;boring, brown clothes. But beautiful clothes were <a href=#>popular</a>, even back then. Most people wore woolen, bright clothes, no&nbsp;matter their social class. But colorful fabric was <a href=#>expensive</a>, and poorer individuals would have clothing with fewer details (or&nbsp;gray, brown, and other dark colors) while the wealthy wore clothes with metal, fur, embroidery, and jewels.</p><p><h2>No&nbsp;people from other countries</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/570/d7f/1ef0395154b71e4b15df37335e.jpg><p>Seeing people of&nbsp;different races wasn’t something too <a href=#>unusual</a> for the Middle Ages. On&nbsp;the streets of&nbsp;European cities, you could see people from Africa and the Middle East. This is&nbsp;more true for the late Middle Ages when trade routes were built and merchants from other countries started to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;Europe.</p><p><h2>Knights’ armor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f02/be9/f63e255114a1b8494a8957030f.jpg><p>Armor wasn’t something that only <a href=#>knights</a> wore. Yes, noble warriors had heavy, high-quality armor, but ordinary soldiers rarely wore just leather clothes to&nbsp;protect themselves. Everyone tried to&nbsp;have at&nbsp;least some armor, most importantly, a&nbsp;helmet. Not all pieces of&nbsp;armor were expensive, so&nbsp;almost everyone could buy something.</p><p>Also, this armor wasn’t as&nbsp;heavy as&nbsp;we&nbsp;imagine. Standard helmets and body armor weighed around 48&nbsp;lb&nbsp;— that’s less than what modern <a href=#>firefighter</a> gear weighs (which can be&nbsp;as&nbsp;heavy as&nbsp;363&nbsp;lb). That being said, knights didn’t need a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;help climbing up&nbsp;onto their horses.</p><p><h2>Impenetrable fortresses</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/50e/5e1/86d961566ea07e12b69bb6a25f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;green meadow, there may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;stone fortress surrounded by&nbsp;a&nbsp;deep trench filled with water. This is&nbsp;how many movies portray a&nbsp;standard castle. However, very few fortresses were made of&nbsp;stone. A&nbsp;castle is&nbsp;first and foremost a&nbsp;home, so&nbsp;most buildings were small and made of&nbsp;<a href=#>wood</a> and mud. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;building was surrounded by&nbsp;a&nbsp;deep trench, it&nbsp;didn’t always have <a href=#>water</a> in&nbsp;it. The walls looked higher and the building was harder to&nbsp;attack.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these myths did you think were true?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ecWamq2rXZavsMHTZquhnV2itqWwy55kmp%2BVqHq1tMCtZKanpp6ytHnGnqtmmZyheri%2BzqeeZnBgZYB1gI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-facts-about-the-middle-ages-that-movies-get-all-wrong-800344.html&text=15%20Facts%20About%20the%20Middle%20Ages%20That%20Movies%20Get%20All%20Wrong&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-facts-about-the-middle-ages-that-movies-get-all-wrong-800344.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-facts-about-the-middle-ages-that-movies-get-all-wrong-800344.html&title=15%20Facts%20About%20the%20Middle%20Ages%20That%20Movies%20Get%20All%20Wrong" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-facts-about-the-middle-ages-that-movies-get-all-wrong-800344.html&title=15%20Facts%20About%20the%20Middle%20Ages%20That%20Movies%20Get%20All%20Wrong" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-facts-about-the-middle-ages-that-movies-get-all-wrong-800344.html&title=15%20Facts%20About%20the%20Middle%20Ages%20That%20Movies%20Get%20All%20Wrong" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-facts-about-the-middle-ages-that-movies-get-all-wrong-800344.html&description=15%20Facts%20About%20the%20Middle%20Ages%20That%20Movies%20Get%20All%20Wrong" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./it-came-from-outer-space-1953.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="1950s Sci-Fi Movies">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-traditional-movie-stereotypes-that-look-so-outdated-812677.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10+ Traditional Movie Stereotypes That Look So Outdated">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
