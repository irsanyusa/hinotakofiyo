More than a third 37% say it’s because they cannot find an NHS dentist to take them on, with a further 5% on a waiting list, while another 23% say they’re not registered because they don’t think they can afford to be treated.</p><h3>One in ten Britons claim to have carried out their own dental work</h3><p>Among the most concerning consequences of Britain’s growing dental deserts is the willingness of some to attempt procedures they need but can’t get.</p><p>One in ten Britons (10%) admit to attempting their own dental work, with most doing so because they were unable, one way or another, to get an appointment with a dentist.</p><p>Of those who say they’ve tried to perform dentistry on themselves, most (56%) did so within the last two years, including 36% who did it within the last year.</p><p>Overall, that means 6% of Britons say they have tried their hand at doing their own dental work within the last two years.</p><h3>Britons report using cement and superglue on their teeth</h3><p>The survey revealed cases of people using cement and superglue to fix crowns and dentures, killing an infection with urine, using ‘heated polybeads’ to replace a missing tooth and applying chemical metal (an adhesive usually used for household or outdoor repairs) as a filling.</p><p>A third (34%) of those who revealed what kind of dental work they’d attempted say they pulled out – or tried to pull out – their own teeth.</p><p>A similar proportion (32%) gave themselves fillings, while others removed or repaired crowns (4%), tried their hand at a scale and polish (4%), filed their broken teeth down (3%) or treated their own abscesses and infections (3%).</p><h3>Why have Britons been attempting their own dentistry?</h3><p>One in five of those who attempted a procedure (20%) did so because they couldn’t get a timely appointment, with an additional 15% saying Covid-related lockdowns prevented them from getting one.</p><p>And 18% of Britons who tried their hand at dentistry say they did it because they couldn’t get registered with a dentist.</p><p>Among other reasons cited were fear of going to the dentist (14%) and an inability to pay for treatment (14%).</p><p>Of those who did so within the last two years, the most common reasons they did were because they could not get registered (22%) or they could not get a timely appointment (22%), while 18% say they could not get an appointment because of lockdowns.</p><h3>One in eight Britons have no confidence they can afford NHS dental care</h3><p>Amid an escalating cost of living crisis, one in eight Britons (12%) say they currently have no confidence in their ability to afford even routine NHS dental care. Another 11% are not very confident they can.</p><p>For emergency NHS treatment, confidence is lower still, with 32% not very or not at all confident they can afford it.</p><p>Confidence drops even further when considering private dental care, with at least half of Britons saying they are not very or not at all confident they can afford routine (52%) or emergency (57%) private treatment.</p><p>When it comes to getting timely dental care in an emergency, four in ten Britons (41%) say they’re not very or not at all confident they can get a routine appointment with a dentist when needed, and 37% are similarly unconfident when it comes to getting an emergency appointment.</p><h3>One in 12 Britons have avoided the dentist’s chair for more than a decade</h3><p>The NHS recommends routine check-ups at intervals of at least six months and at the most, two years.</p><p>And despite the ongoing problems in dental care, 46% of Britons say they’ve seen a dentist within the last six months, rising to 70% for those who’ve seen one within two years.</p><p>However, a quarter (27%) of Britons haven’t been for two years or more, including 8% who admit it’s been more than a decade since they were in a dentist’s chair.</p><p>Among those not currently registered with a dentist, the picture is more worrying – just 19% have visited a dentist within the last two years, while 31% say they haven’t been in more than ten years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGqBdnyMqKWeZaSau26u0aKrqKajYrWiwsRmp56qlqS%2FrrHDZpuepqSewLW%2B2GaroZ2dqLKtwsQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f45450-one-ten-britons-have-performed-dentistry-themselve.html&text=One%20in%20ten%20Britons%20have%20performed%20dentistry%20on%20themselves%2c%20half%20in%20the%20last%20two%20years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f45450-one-ten-britons-have-performed-dentistry-themselve.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f45450-one-ten-britons-have-performed-dentistry-themselve.html&title=One%20in%20ten%20Britons%20have%20performed%20dentistry%20on%20themselves%2c%20half%20in%20the%20last%20two%20years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f45450-one-ten-britons-have-performed-dentistry-themselve.html&title=One%20in%20ten%20Britons%20have%20performed%20dentistry%20on%20themselves%2c%20half%20in%20the%20last%20two%20years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f45450-one-ten-britons-have-performed-dentistry-themselve.html&title=One%20in%20ten%20Britons%20have%20performed%20dentistry%20on%20themselves%2c%20half%20in%20the%20last%20two%20years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f45450-one-ten-britons-have-performed-dentistry-themselve.html&description=One%20in%20ten%20Britons%20have%20performed%20dentistry%20on%20themselves%2c%20half%20in%20the%20last%20two%20years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./philando-castile-police-shooting-minnesota.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Philando Castile's Mom Says Black People Are 'Being Hunted'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1528155-new-kids-block-nkotb-members-what.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New Kids On The Block (NKOTB) members: what are they up to now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
