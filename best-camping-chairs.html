Whether fishing by the lake for an afternoon, hiking to the farthest end of the trail, or exploring parts unknown, you deserve a much better seat wherever your adventures take you.</p><p>Nature lovers need a quality camping chair that’s easy to store and carry with your gear, will easily survive the elements, and provides relaxing, body-supporting comfort to recharge you for the next leg of the journey. With so many camping chairs on the market—ranging from expensive, luxury ergonomic designs to the fairly-priced yet feature-packed models, and everything in between—looking for the best camping chair for your needs can be overwhelming.</p><p>After extensive research and many hours of hands-on testing in the wild, we’ve compiled a list of the all-around greatest camping chairs available, with plenty of key tips to ensure that your next camping trip is that much cozier.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-camping-chair>What to consider when choosing a camping chair</h2><h3>Portability and weight</h3><p>If you’re pulling a set of camping chairs from the back of your truck or RV after driving onto your campsite, you shouldn’t worry about how bulky or heavy your favorite seat is, as long as it’s reliably comfortable and incorporates the features you need.</p><p>On the other hand, anyone hiking with their camping gear will want chairs made of sturdy, yet featherweight aluminum to drastically lighten the overall load. These premium camping chairs are often collapsible, easy to set up in under a minute, and include a handy, mini carrying case for maximum portability. The minimal downsides of a lightweight camping chair are that they’re easily blown over on a breezy day and may seem relatively unstable when compared to larger steel-framed chairs at first, but seasoned adventurers will appreciate the feel of a 1.2-pound chair in their pack over a 7-pound model anytime.</p><h3>Comfort and support</h3><p>Just because you’re out in the wilderness doesn’t mean you have to sprawl on the ground like an animal. Generally speaking, the pricier a camping chair is, the more comfortable it will be—bottom of the barrel camping chairs are dirt cheap, but tend to be boxy, flimsy, and provide minimal support.</p><p>Some of the key points to look for when looking for a particularly comfortable camping chair include the ability to recline, a headrest, an elevated seat, and adjustable armrests. In addition, it’s worth considering a chair’s width, shape, seat height, flexibility, weight capacity, and whether or not it has a cozy ergonomic design to ensure it will be a good fit for your body type. Campers who need a deluxe chair may be interested in premium comfort options such as a heated seat or cozy rocking feature.</p><p>Keep in mind that some of the most comfortable camping chairs are also relatively heavy, so be weary of models with a foldable steel frame or a bulky design if you need a portable camping chair.</p><h3>Durability and materials</h3><p>The best camping chairs are as durable as they are comfortable, so they can easily withstand the elements for years of enjoying the great outdoors. Most chairs are lined with a polyester fabric, since this material is lightweight, surprisingly rugged, and weather resistant, but nylon and canvas are solid alternatives.</p><p>Both aluminum and steel chair frames are extremely durable, but aluminum models are much lighter and easier to pack for hiking expeditions. Steel camping chairs are the more durable of the two, but are better suited for short walks from your car to the campsite as they’re much heavier and more cumbersome than their aluminum counterparts.</p><h3>Ease of use</h3><p>Comfort and weight are the two most important factors when selecting a camping chair, but usability is a key point to consider as well. Some of the lightest camping chairs were made to be fully disassembled and stored in a bag between uses, but many of these essentially assemble themselves thanks to the elastic, shock-corded frame literally pulling itself together after you’ve pulled it out of its bag. Alternatively, some models fold down like beach chairs, while others collapse inward to be stowed in the slim shoulder bag it came with.</p><p>The ability to quickly unpack and set up your trusty camping chair as soon as you need to take a load off is incredibly convenient, and it’s worth looking for video reviews online to see how simple a chair you’re considering is to assemble and take down.</p><h3>Additional features</h3><p>Comfort is king, but extras like dual cup holders, mesh storage pockets for your gear, a convenient carrying bag, and a range of cool color options to choose from are certainly attractive bonus features to keep an eye out for when comparing camping chairs.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks->Our top picks</h2><h3>Most versatile camping chair: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Helinox Sunset Chair</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/2690f2ce264c50fd53779085d958cae2/76902/Helinox-Sunset-Chair-side.jpg> </span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/d1ce4f0f57ab7fa123a75c91de2020b7/76902/Helinox-Sunset-Chair-front.jpg></span><p>If you’re tired of searching for the perfect balance of truly comfortable and portable, the Helinox Sunset camping chair may be the solution you’ve been looking for. You wouldn’t expect a camping chair that barely weighs more than three pounds to feature a body-cradling ergonomic design this comfy, but it gets even better when you take its adjustable headset and premium back support into consideration.</p><p>Campers who aren’t impressed with chairs hovering just above the dirt underfoot won’t mind carrying around this featherweight, compact alternate option with the rest of their gear, as its wide aluminum alloy frame provides reliable stability and durability in equal measure. The Sunset’s innovative elastic shock-corded frame practically assembles itself, and it’s just as easy to take it down and pack up when you need to hit the trail again.</p><p>Some may not be happy that this camping chair lacks cupholders and that its mesh pockets are admittedly tiny, but you can’t find a model that better combines the luxurious comfort of a bulky lounger with the advanced level of portability that Helinox chairs are known for. If it’s in your budget, the Sunset camping chair is worth every penny.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $169.95</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 38.5 inches (height) x 23 inches (width) x 28.5 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>: 14 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 3.25 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 320 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>High back and longer legs for premium comfort</li><li>Featherweight</li><li>Extremely simple to assemble</li><li>Plush headrest</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Easy to sit back and relax in for all body types</li><li>Surprisingly sturdy</li><li>Compact</li><li>Rugged design</li><li>Available in nine eye-catching colors</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Its mesh pockets are a little too slim, no armrests</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Sunset Chair</h3></p><h3>Best budget camping chair: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Kelty Essential Chair</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/6fe4d66e59270b2ee20fcac517010ad0/76902/Kelty-Essential.jpg></span><p>Buying a nice set of camping gear can be hard on your wallet, especially if you have your eye on premium tents, bags, and other items. But for anyone who needs to get their money’s worth, Kelty’s Essential Chair is easily the best budget-friendly model out there. While it lacks the high-end ergonomic back support found in pricier models, the Essential Chair features a set of adjustable arm rests, a rugged, powder-coated steel frame, and is a breeze to set up at a moment’s notice when you need to get off your feet. Perhaps its most valuable feature is its pair of insulated cup holders, which are perfect for keeping drinks hot or cold for much longer—a handy add-on rarely seen even in much pricier camping chairs.</p><p>While it weighs seven pounds, Kelty’s Essential Chair includes a helpful strapped carrying bag, and its wide base provides extra stability for camping by the lake or beach. It’s not the best chair for back support, but between its impressive durability, usability, and versatility, this is the best camping chair you can find for under $80.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $74.95</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 37 inches (height) x 21 inches (width) x x 21.5 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>:16.5 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 7 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 300 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Adjustable armrests</li><li>Steel frame</li><li>Insulated cup holders</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Lightweight</li><li>Plush material</li><li>Durable</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Solid, but not especially ergonomically designed for cozy back support</li></ul><h3>Best lightweight camping chair: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Helinox Chair One</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/6e7c00ff11997894a297e3d1eeb438a5/76902/Helinox-CHAIR-ONE.jpg> </span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/a7b1ace021d26febe3af6d30cff01349/76902/Helinox-CHAIR-ONE-another-angle.jpg></span><p>Campers who value portability above all else will be pleasantly surprised at the Helinox Chair One’s featherweight build and posture-supporting design. At just over two pounds, and easy to stuff into its tiny companion carrying bag, you can’t find a better chair to strap onto the side of your favorite camping bags and then instantly forget it’s even there. The Chair One’s aluminum frame is dependably durable and the creatively designed bungee-like system of elastic inside effortlessly pulls itself together in seconds.</p><p>The Chair One’s wider stance felt sturdy on solid ground, and while its pointed feet aren’t well-suited for sandier environments, as long as you can set it on level earth, you’ll be fine. Although Helinox’s vibrantly colored Chair Ones aren’t as cozy as a big reclining model, it’s without a doubt the most comfortable chair in its weight class by miles, and a must-own for campers who tend to walk long distances with their gear.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $109.95</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 25.5 inches (height) x 19.5 (width) x 20 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong> : 10 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 2.12 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 320 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Lightweight, durable aluminum</li><li>Self-assembling design</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Featherweight</li><li>Effortless assembly</li><li>Rugged materials</li><li>Comfortable</li><li>Available in 10 attractive colors</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>May be a little low to the ground for some campers</li></ul><h3>Best camping rocking chair: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Alps Mountaineering Breeze Rocker</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/10351b7b25bf9266cb9dba87aac0bfe8/01d42/Alps-Mountaineering-Breeze-Rocker-.jpg></span><p>When it comes to durability, stability, and overall comfort, Alps Mountaineering’s Breeze Rocker is the most impressive rocking camping chair on the market. The Breeze Rocker’s wide seat, high weight capacity, and breathable TechMesh material accommodates most body types, and its hefty powder-coated steel frame was made to last. Most importantly, the Breeze Rocker’s signature feature is a gentle and cozy rocking motion. With its wide, stable base and ergonomically designed seat, you’ll be tempted to relax a little longer than you normally would.</p><p>This model’s biggest caveats are its substantial weight of just under 16lbs, and the lack of a handy carrying bag, but it is a snap to fold down, locks into place with a notable click, and was clearly designed for short strolls from your camper to the beachside. If you want to rock yourself to sleep under the stars, the Breeze Rocker is without a doubt your coziest option.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>:$159.99</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 41 inches (height) x 24 inches (width) x 17.5 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>: 21 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 15.75 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 300 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Foldable, solid steel frame</li><li>Cozy, weather resistant material</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Smooth rocking action</li><li>Securely locks into place when folded and unfolded properly</li><li>Supportive and breathable material</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Does not include a carrying bag</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Breeze Rocker</h3></p><h3>Best heavy-duty camping chair: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Yeti Trailhead Camp Chair</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/af45b8e5429cf693a036ebd01bb857d4/8cfe4/yeti-trailhead.jpg></span><p>When it comes to premium durability, Yeti’s hulk of a camping chair easily dominates the competition, with its powder-coated steel frame and extremely rugged FlexGrid fabric. The heavy-duty frame isn’t just durable—its wide stance ensures that it isn’t going to blow over in anything less than a severe thunderstorm. This chair is as comfortable as it is sturdy, as its proprietary breathable and durable FlexGrid material conforms to your body, and its upright backrest provides a level of ergonomic upper and lower back support rarely seen in other models.</p><p>While camping enthusiasts will love melting into an extremely comfortable Yeti Trailhead, there are two points that hold this otherwise impressive model back: Its sky-high price and substantial weight of 13.3lbs. This chair includes a comfortable backpack-like carrying bag that’s just as durable as the Trailhead itself, but its weighty design makes this comfy and ultra-rugged model best suited for short walks from the camper to the lakeside or beach.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $300</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 43 inches (height) x 8 inches (width) x 10 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>: (Unlisted)</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 13.3 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 500 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Supportive and breathable mesh material</li><li>Ultra-rugged steel frame</li><li>Cup holder</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Designed to comfortably seat all body types</li><li>Built to last</li><li>Easy to adjust material tension for maximum comfort</li><li>UV-resistant fabric</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>High price tag</li><li>Heavy frame</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Yeti Trailhead Camp Chair</h3></p><h3>Best camping recliner chair: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>NEMO Moonlite Reclining Camp Chair</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/e47228e7b7c7b24094b7d60e69d1165e/aeb26/nemo-moonlight.jpg></span><p>The idea of easily carrying a genuinely comfortable, reclining camping chair along on a lengthy hike sounded absurd, until we discovered the Nemo Moonlight Reclining Chair. At just 1.8lbs, this lightweight model is worth throwing in your pack for the range of reclining motion it provides. The chair’s brilliantly designed ball and socket joint connectors and stretchy, body-conforming, breathable material work together to eliminate uncomfortable pressure points for a reliably cozy, weightless-feeling lounging experience, no matter how far back you recline.</p><p>Of course, its light and airy seating sensation is its greatest feature, but the Moonlight’s featherweight aluminum frame is also especially rugged, while its wide stance helps to keep it from sinking into the ground for a more stable recline, and its intuitive design makes it a literal snap to assemble and take apart. If you’ve been searching high and low for a consistently comfortable, yet surprisingly lightweight reclining camping chair, the Nemo Moonlight is your best bet.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $159.95</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 26 inches (height) x 20 inches (width) x 20 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>: 10.5 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 1.8 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 300 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Innovative recliner allows for a wide range of positions</li><li>Durable materials</li><li>Conforms to your body shape</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Reliably supportive and comfortable</li><li>Featherweight</li><li>Available in 6 colors</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>May not be the best fit for wider campers</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>NEMO Moonlite Reclining Camp Chair</h3></p><h3>Best camping chair for a bad back: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>KingCamp Ergonomics Adjustable High Back Camping Chair</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/b0d4659d9c4a71137bb680033c92989d/a69b9/KingCamp-Ergonomics-Adjustable-High-Back-Camping-Chairs.jpg></span><p>Every bit as rugged as it is relaxing to lean back in, KingCamp’s premium chair sports an ergonomically designed high back support, a highly adjustable reclining feature, and breathable, padded fabric that makes it easy for campers with spinal issues to comfortably lay back and enjoy the great outdoors. Although, at just under 14 pounds, the awkwardly-named Ergonomics Adjustable High Back Camping Chair is a bulky model, as a specialist option to accommodate adventurers with back issues, it’s well-worth bringing along in its convenient carrying bag. Easy to assemble for the first time and easier to fold down for transport, this camping chair’s durable steel frame and thicker, supportive material is reliably sturdy.</p><p>While there are other camping recliners, KingCamp’s standout model effortlessly reclines to lay completely horizontal, an incredibly convenient ability that adventurers who need to get the kinks out of their back will deeply appreciate. Its higher seat supports a natural sitting position for your knees and lower back, the armrests adjust to suit your height, and its tall backrest and solid, yet breathable oxford fabric does wonders for supporting your neck and upper back.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $139.99</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 43.7 inches (height) x 24 inches (width) x 32.6 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat</strong> <strong>height</strong>: 17.1 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 13.9 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 300 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Flexible, reclining back with ergonomic headrest</li><li>Mesh back pocket</li><li>Drink holder</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Thick, supportive and durable materials</li><li>Easy to adjust</li><li>Consistently comfortable</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>It could be a little lighter to carry around, especially for someone with back pain</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>KingCamp Ergonomics Adjustable High Back Camping Chair</h3></p><h3>Best folding camping chair: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Alps Mountaineering Lay-Z Lounger</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/ab16994b6b1556f4b287ab7dcd2097b3/16038/LAY-Z-LOUNGER.jpg></span><p>There’s no reason to settle for a basic folding chair when you can splurge for a luxurious option like the Alps Mountaineering Lay-Z Lounger. Like many other folding camping chairs, the Lay-Z Lounger quickly folds down for easy storage and transport, but its adjustable, plush headrest, ergonomically designed armrests, and impressive range of reclining motion sets it apart from the rest of the pack.</p><p>Getting comfy is as simple as leaning back and setting your favorite reclining position in place with its handy locking mechanism, and with this camping chair’s wide, stable stance and breathable, body-conforming Nylon fabric, you’d better point it at a beautiful view, because once you’re locked in, you won’t want to get back up for a while.</p><p>Although its powder-coated steel frame is reassuringly solid, this is easily the weightiest camping chair to make our list, at a whopping 21 pounds. Between its hefty design and lack of a carrying bag, this folding lounge chair is best for short strolls to the campground, but its compact folded form, relaxing reclining action, and premium durability is certainly worth the higher price tag.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $179.99</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 44 inches (height) x 25 inches (width) x 21 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>: 25 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 21 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 300 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Reclines to any position for maximum comfort</li><li>Extremely sturdy steel frame</li><li>Foldable</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Premium reclining motion and cozy headrest makes it easy to snooze in</li><li>Surprisingly tough</li><li>Effortlessly folds down for storage</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Heavy for a camping chair</li><li>Only available in tan</li></ul><h3>Best camping chair for kids: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Helinox Ground Chair</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/c27e6a435fdae43c1ce6711aaf880937/76902/helinox-ground-chair-side.jpg> </span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/faa9ec25425b0cea841dbe487cae6ab3/76902/helinox-ground-chair-next-to-other-chairs.jpg></span><p>Helinox’s Ground Chair is a top-tier pick for anyone weighing under 265 pounds, as its low profile, featherweight build, and surprisingly rugged design is perfectly suited to little campers. Weighing in at under two pounds and able to collapse into a tiny carrying bag, the Ground Chair is effortlessly simple to fit into your backpack as you head off towards far-off campgrounds. The Ground Chair’s breathable mesh material is suitably comfortable, and its elastic, shock-corded aluminum frame does most of the work of assembly when it’s time for a break. Nearly indestructible, extremely lightweight, and surprisingly comfortable, this tiny, yet versatile camping chair is worth the price for keeping kids comfortable while making smores by the campfire.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $129.95</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 19.7 inches (height) x 20 inches (width) x 17.3 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>: 4.5 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 1.43.pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 265 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Featherweight</li><li>Well-spaced legs won’t sink into soft ground</li><li>Breathable material</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Extremely easy to assemble</li><li>Rugged build</li><li>Easy to pack and carry</li><li>Surprisingly comfortable</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Being this low to the ground isn’t for everyone</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Ground Chair</h3></p><h3>Best feature-rich camping chair: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Big Agnes Big Six Armchair</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/2ff19a9d49bc6bc9e0b07442f8252c93/36dbb/big-agnes-big-six-armchair.jpg></span><p>It’s rare to find a camping chair that has incorporated enough comfort-focused features to comfortably sit a wide range of body types, but the Big Six Armchair from Big Agnes has pulled it off. Taller, wider, and heavier campers will appreciate this model’s 20” inch seat height, bigger sides, and towering back, as they come together to provide genuinely comfortable knee, back, and neck support. Although the Big Six is optimized for bigger users, smaller campers will feel cradled and cozy, nestled in this roomy and extra-stable chair.</p><p>In addition to its universally comfortable design, the Big Six Armchair’s notable features include a pair of cupholders, a lightweight and durable aluminum build, and a color-coded frame that makes assembly a snap. The two unfortunate aspects of this otherwise great camping chair are its ability to catch the breeze like a sail and topple over if no one’s sitting in it, and its high price, but if you’re a big and tall camper, this is hands-down your best bet.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $249.95</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 40 inches (height) x 26 inches (width) x 24 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>: 20 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 4.12 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 300 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>High seat</li><li>Speedy set-up</li><li>Bigger seat space</li><li>Compact</li><li>Sturdy</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Made for wide and tall campers</li><li>Excellent neck and back support</li><li>Dual bottle holders</li><li>Lightweight</li><li>8 stylish colors</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>So light that it’s easily blown over when you’re not seated</li><li>Expensive</li></ul><h3>Best camping chair for two campers: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Kelty Low Loveseat</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/b40ea8524ad37ee8a0ba339b7bd5168b/76902/LOW-LOVESEAT.jpg></span><p>Why buy two quality camping chairs for you and your number one camping buddy, when you can get a sofa-like Kelty Low Loveseat and sit together instead? This double-seater features a wide seating area, a thick and well-cushioned material that’s extremely comfortable to lounge on with a friend or your dog, and setup is as simple as pulling its armrests apart to extend the loveseat, making it an especially user-friendly model for camping parties.</p><p>There is one seemingly deceptive aspect of this impressive camping chair, though: While it may seem roomy enough to comfortably seat three, the support beam running along the middle ruins that idea if you try it. That aside,, Kelty’s Low Loveseat is a plush and cozy chair, with a set of spacious cup holders and an extra-wide base that makes it one of the most stable camping chairs on this list. Its large frame, resilient material, and impressive 400lb weight limit understandably translates to a heavy 15lbs chair, making it a top pick for shorter walks to and from the campsite with friends.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $139.95</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 31.5 inches (height) x 44 inches (width) x 23.5 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>: 12.5 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 15.38 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 400 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Spacious seating for two</li><li>Two large bottle holders</li><li>Quilted and comfortable material</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Soft and supportive seating</li><li>Especially durable</li><li>Adjustable armrests</li><li>3 color options</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Its supportive pole makes sitting in the exact middle uncomfortable (so don’t do that)</li></ul><h3>Most luxurious camping chair: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Snow Peak Luxury Low Beach Chair</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/5e1e19f162a6018ae7cca3ddd86f04e2/3a646/Luxury-Low-Beach-Chair.jpg></span><p>The average camping chair isn’t known for turning heads, but while the chic design of a Snow Peak Luxury Low Beach Chair will grab your attention, its versatility, durability, and cozy feel will keep it long after you’ve returned home. Its soft, yet resilient canvas material and lower back support pairs well with its extra-low seat, and its fairly lightweight materials and slim carrying bag ensures that campers can easily take this stylish, collapsible chair along for the adventure.</p><p>Although intended for camping, you’ll be tempted to keep this luxurious chair on your porch or patio with the rest of your outdoor furniture thanks to its rugged, rust-resistant aluminum frame, the spacious mesh pocket on its back, and slick, teak wood armrests. Snow Peak’s best camping chair was designed with that perfect balance of form and function, so don’t be surprised if your camping buddies want to give it a try.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $249.95</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 27 inches (height) x 26 inches (width) x 23 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>:12 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 7.5 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 240 pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Spacious mesh storage pocket</li><li>Aluminum body</li><li>Foldable</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Comfortable, ergonomic design</li><li>Stylish, teak wood arms</li><li>Rugged construction</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Relatively pricey</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Snow Peak Luxury Low Beach Chair</h3></p><h3>Best heated camping chair: Kuma Outdoor Gear Lazy Bear Heated Chair</h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/f6ddc2b381881afcdf1dcdb819106592/53790/Lazy-Bear-Heated-Chair.png></span><p>Campers in cooler climates experience the best and worst parts of roughing it in autumn weather, but what if you found a luxurious camping chair that makes those chilly fall days and nights bearable? The Kuma Lazy Bear sports an extra-wide seat and plush back and sides that already make it feel like you’re cuddling up on a piece of soft indoor furniture, but this edition includes an integrated heater with low, medium, and high settings, with a battery pack that provides up to six hours of continuous warmth.</p><p>It would have been incredible if the Lazy Bear’s backrest warmed alongside its toasty seat, but sadly, it doesn’t. It’s also unfortunate that this beast of a chair weighs in at an unwieldy 15 pounds. Still, if you aren’t lugging this big model too far to your campsite, its long-lasting warmed seat, soft padding, and tall, wind-shielding back and arm rests easily makes it the best heated camping chair on the market.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: $210</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 34 inches (height) x 34 inches (width) x 27 inches (depth)</li><li><strong>Seat height</strong>: 16 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>:15 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight capacity</strong>: 350.pounds</li></ul><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>3 toasty heat settings</li><li>Insulated drink holder</li><li>Spacious seat</li><li>Wide and stable legs</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Up to 6 hours of heat</li><li>Durable material</li><li>Dependably cozy</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Only the seat heats</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Kuma Outdoor Gear Lazy Bear Heated Chair</h3></p><h2 id=how-we-tested-and-selected-the-best-camping-chairs>How we tested and selected the best camping chairs</h2><p>Our comprehensive research of both big-name and niche camping gear manufacturers and their various products, rigorous testing, and prior experience with camping chairs led us to hand select the best models available today. The most important factors that we considered included comfort, features, weight, usability, durability, price, style, and overall satisfaction with each chair’s performance.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the best material for camping chairs?</h3><p>Although you’ll find a few models made with canvas or a signature synthetic blend, the vast majority of camping chairs utilize polyester fabric in their designs. Ripstop polyester is difficult to cut or tear by accident, is water and weather resistant, and notably lightweight, making it a popular pick for camping gear manufacturers and nature enthusiasts alike.</p><h3>Which brand of folding chair is the best?</h3><p>The Lay-Z Lounger, from Alps Mountaineering, is a particularly impressive model due to its wide range of reclining positions, especially durable steel frame, and how simple it is to fold down for storage. While it’s on the heavier side for a camping chair, the Lay-Z Lounger’s comfortable canvas material and plush headrest makes it surprisingly easy to nod off once you’ve found your optimum reclining angle.</p><h3>Are Helinox chairs worth it?</h3><p>If you’re a dedicated camper, absolutely! Helinox’s camping chairs are known for their featherweight aluminum alloy frames, which makes them both incredibly durable and much easier to hike with when compared to bulkier, steel models. In addition, expect a Helinox chair to utilize reinforced polyester for a more comfortable feel and enhanced durability, as well as an extremely easy to assemble design so you can get off your feet that much faster.</p><p>As an added bonus, many Helinox camping chairs are offered in a rainbow of eye-catching colors, so you can find a cozy chair that matches your style.</p><h3>Which chair material is best for sitting for a long time?</h3><p>Like backpacks and tents, many camping chairs are made of lightweight and durable polyester, so it’s important to look for ergonomically designed models if you’re in the market for a quality chair to lounge in nature for hours on end.</p><p>When you’re comparing models, look for chairs touting features like an adjustable headrest and armrests, as well as the ability to recline. These key points make it easy for campers to customize their chair to better fit their body type.</p><h3>How much should I spend on a good chair?</h3><p>There is certainly a bit of truth to the phrase, “You get what you pay for,” so when it comes to camping chairs, expect to pay anywhere from at least $80 to around $170 for a genuinely good chair that is comfortable, feature-rich, and built to last.</p><p>Cheaper chairs may be tempting, but they won’t last nearly as long in the elements and are half as comfortable as pricier counterparts. If you plan on spending a lot of time on the beach or in the woods, it’s well worth investing in a superior model anyway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lk5a6sbXNoGScoJGev7R7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-camping-chairs.html&text=Best%20Camping%20Chairs%20for%20Relaxing%20in%20Style&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-camping-chairs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-camping-chairs.html&title=Best%20Camping%20Chairs%20for%20Relaxing%20in%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-camping-chairs.html&title=Best%20Camping%20Chairs%20for%20Relaxing%20in%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-camping-chairs.html&title=Best%20Camping%20Chairs%20for%20Relaxing%20in%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-camping-chairs.html&description=Best%20Camping%20Chairs%20for%20Relaxing%20in%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./les-regions-recoivent-22-millions-deuros-pour-compenser-le-transfert-de-services-formation-au-1er.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Les rgions reoivent 2,2 millions d'euros pour compenser le transfert de services formation au 1e">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./money-issues-12-funny-memes-we-can-possibly-relate-with.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="12 funny memes we can possibly relate with">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
