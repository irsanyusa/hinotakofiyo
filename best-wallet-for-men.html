However, sifting through the different types of wallets, from traditional leather bifolds and slim card holders to pared down money clips and theft resistant trifolds, can feel like a bigger challenge than you want to undertake. Once you know what specifications fit your needs best, though, finding the best wallet to match your style isn’t difficult. Since you’re likely going to carry your wallet each and every day, it’s important that you settle on one that suits your unique needs and preferred aesthetic.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-wallets-for-men>Our top picks for the best wallets for men</h2><h3>Best affordable wallet for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Timberland Milled Leather Bifold Wallet</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best affordable wallet for men</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Men's Milled Leather Bifold Wallet</h3></p><p>At this price, it’s hard to beat the quality of the Timberland Milled Leather Bifold Wallet. Although the leather isn’t as thin and supple as more expensive wallets, it’s durable and will wear well with time. The exposed double stitching further enhances durability while adding to the simple, but pleasing design. Plus, like most products from Timberland, it’s designed for use in rough conditions. But, that doesn’t mean the Milled Bifold Wallet can’t be used for everyday carry, formal or casual.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 4.3 inches long x 3.4 inches wide x 0.4 inches thick</li><li>Capacity: 8+ cards, 10+ bills</li><li>Material: Milled leather</li><li>Colors: Brown</li><li>Warranty: 1-year standard warranty</li><li>Price: $38 from <a rel=nofollow href=#>Timberland</a></li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Includes two ID windows, both with thumb slots for easy access</li><li>Flip-up card slot offers privacy from prying eyes for cards with sensitive information</li><li>Made from thick, durable leather</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The design is quite simple, and there is only one color to choose from</li></ul><h3>Best slim wallet for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Leatherology Thin Bifold Wallet</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best slim wallet for men</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Thin Bifold Wallet</h3></p><p>The Thin Bifold Wallet from Leatherology combines the versatility and function of a traditional bifold with the design of a modern, <a rel=alternate href=#>minimalist wallet</a>. With six card slots, two interior pockets, and a full-sized bill compartment that can accommodate notes larger than standard United States bills, this wallet has ample room to carry your essentials. Even when it’s packed with cards, receipts, and other odds and ends, you will still be able to comfortably carry it in your front or back pocket. Another great feature is that the smooth leather lets it easily slide into and out of your pockets, so you won’t have to worry about fumbling around your pants when it comes time to pay.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 3.4 inches long x 4.15 inches wide x 0.5 inches thick</li><li>Capacity: 6 credit card slots</li><li>Material: Full grain leather</li><li>Colors: Black, brown, navy blue, cognac</li><li>Warranty: 1-year limited warranty</li><li>Price: $70-$100 from <a rel=nofollow href=#>Leatherology</a></li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>This wallet looks, feels, and performs better than the price would suggest</li><li>Great storage considering the size</li><li>For a small fee, you can also get this wallet personalized</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The standard edition Thin Bifold Wallet from leatherology has plain looks, and if you want to get a more interesting leather, you have to shell out another $30</li></ul><h3>Best bifold wallet for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ekster Modular Bifold</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best bifold wallet for men</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Ekster Modular Bifold</h3></p><p>As the name suggests, this wallet has excellent versatility thanks to the fact that it comes with a magnetically held removable card-holder, as well as a slim coin pouch. Both of these are fully removable, so you can customize your wallet to your daily needs. Plus, the Ekster Bifold comes with a built-in tracker, which can come in handy if you lose your wallet.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 4.1 inches long x 2.3 inches wide x 0.29 inches thick</li><li>Capacity: 1-12 cards and/or bills</li><li>Material: Eco-tanned leather</li><li>Colors: Caramel, brown, black</li><li>Warranty: 1-year standard warranty</li><li>Price: $64-$80 depending on whether you add a tracker card from <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ekster</a></li></ul><h4>What we like</h4><ul><li>The tracking feature enhances security while providing peace of mind</li><li>The leather is high quality and sustainably produced</li><li>It’s hard to beat the price considering it has worldwide tracking capability</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like</h4><ul><li>The colors to choose from aren’t exciting</li><li>When the card holder is removed, there’s just an empty space left in your wallet</li></ul><h3>Best minimalist wallet for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bellroy Slim Sleeve</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best minimalist wallet for men</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Slim Sleeve</h3></p><p>The Bellroy Slim Sleeve pairs simple design with everyday convenience features. Although it looks like it only holds a few cards, there is ample storage. The Slim Sleeve is able to keep everything organized because it’s packed with innovative designs: Card slides, for example, tend to come with metal cardholders, rather than leather wallets. However, for the Slim Sleeve, Bellroy designed a luxurious, leather-wrapped card slide that neatly fits into the interior pocket. All of your less-frequently used cards are kept out of sight until you need them, and when you do need them, you can access them all by simply pulling a tab.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 3.7 inches long x 3.1 inches wide</li><li>Capacity: 5-11 cards, 5-7 bills</li><li>Material: Full grain leather</li><li>Colors: 10+ colors and patterns to choose from</li><li>Warranty: 3-year standard warranty</li><li>Price: $65 at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bellroy</a></li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>This wallet is ultra slim, but doesn't skimp on space</li><li>There are lots of colorways and patterns to choose from</li><li>Both of the front card slots have a notch in them for easy access, which looks much better than the traditional plastic ID cover with a thumb slide</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some customers reported that the leather loosened more than expected after a few months of use</li></ul><h3>Best leather wallet for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Coach Slim Billfold</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best leather wallet for men</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Coach Slim Billfold</h3></p><p>The Coach Slim Bifold has a classic design, high quality materials, the backing of a reputable brand and best of all, doesn’t break the bank. Instead of relying on screaming logos to get your attention, the Slim Bifold from Coach evidences its luxury through quality. The split sport-calf leather is pleasing to touch and equally rugged. Not only will it wear nicely, it’s easier to maintain than traditional calf leather. Overall, this is a great wallet that performs well in all the essential categories.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 4 inches long x 3 inches wide x 0.5 inches thick</li><li>Capacity: 6+ cards, 10+ bills</li><li>Material: Split calf leather</li><li>Colors: Black, saddle brown, mahogany brown</li><li>Warranty: 1-year standard warranty</li><li>Price: $150 from <a rel=nofollow href=#>Coach</a></li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Made with Coach’s signature buttery-smooth leather</li><li>Large bill compartment for carrying cash, receipts and other paper notes</li><li>Reasonably priced for the brand and quality</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Limited colors to choose from, and only one type of leather to choose from as well</li></ul><h3>Best metal wallet for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Titanium Ridge Wallet</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best metal wallet for men</span></p><p><h3 class=title>RIDGE WALLET</h3></p><p>The Ridge wallet was designed with durability in mind, and this is one of the toughest metal wallets on the market. If you’re looking for something you can toss into bags for an outdoor trip without having to worry, or if you work on a jobsite, this is the wallet for you. You can choose from just the metal wallet or you can get an additional cash strap, money clip or both. The cash strap is a nice alternative to a money clip because it can secure a greater variety of items, such as your car keys or even a miniature flashlight, while a money clip is limited to paper items.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 3.4 inches long x 2.1 inches wide x 0.2 inches thick</li><li>Capacity: 1-12 cards</li><li>Material: Titanium</li><li>Colors: 15 colors to choose from</li><li>Warranty: Lifetime warranty</li><li>Price: $110 from <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ridge</a></li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Titanium is both lightweight and durable</li><li>Excellent warranty</li><li>Fair price for the materials and quality</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Although the titanium doesn’t dent, it does show scratches fairly easily</li><li>Adjusting the size isn’t as intuitive as Ridge makes it seem</li></ul><h3>Best smart wallet for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ekster Vachetta Parliament Wallet</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best smart wallet for men</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Vachetta Parliament Wallet</h3></p><p>The combination of materials is luxurious and good-looking, and more importantly, durable.

It’s large enough to keep your personal items, and even those of your family, and can accommodate all types of currency, paper or coins. And while it’s made from high quality, smooth leather, it doesn’t look so fancy that someone may want to take it from you – the last thing you want is a travel wallet that makes you a target.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 9 inches long x 5.25 inches wide x 0.6 inches thick</li><li>Capacity: 7 cards, 4 separate bill compartments, 4 passports</li><li>Material: Full grain leather, nickel</li><li>Colors: Black, bordeaux, navy blue, cognac, azure, lilac</li><li>Warranty: 1-year limited warranty</li><li>Price: $125 from <a rel=nofollow href=#>Leatherology</a></li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Slim enough to slide into the front pocket of your backpack or alongside your computer in a laptop slide</li><li>Large storage capacity for different sized items</li><li>Durable, all-metal zipper</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>RFID protection costs an extra $15</li></ul><h3>Best men’s wallet/iPhone case combo: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bellroy Phone Case</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best men’s wallet/iPhone case combo</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Phone Case – 3 Card</h3></p><p>There’s no better way to cut down on the size of your wallet than by getting rid of it altogether and merging its function into another essential product you already own. That’s where the Bellroy Phone Case comes in. This handy phone case protects your iPhone while also holding your most essential cards, and maybe even a folded bill. Where the Bellroy Phone Case stands out from the crowd is in the slimness of the wallet portion, and the quality of the leather that surrounds the case. If you don’t want to replace your wallet, you can treat the Bellroy Phone Case as a ‘bonus’ wallet of sorts. You may want to use the phone case to carry your daily essentials while keeping a wallet in case you need cash or go on a trip.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: Length and width of your Iphone Model x 0.6 inches thick</li><li>Capacity: 3 cards</li><li>Material: Eco-tanned leather</li><li>Colors: Black, cobalt, lagoon, terracotta, citrus</li><li>Warranty: 3-year standard warranty</li><li>Price: $45-$79 depending on your phone at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bellroy</a></li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>The slim profile makes the wallet portion feel like it’s not there</li><li>Efficiently performs the key function of a wallet and phone case at the same time</li><li>Top notch leather is used throughout the wallet</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Although three cards is enough to get around your workplace or college campus, it’s not enough to bring everything you need for a trip</li><li>Only compatible with the Iphone</li></ul><h3>Best tactical wallet for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Trayvax Contour Wallet</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best tactical wallet for men</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Contour Wallet - Raw Tobacco Brown</h3></p><p>The Contour Wallet is designed to keep your cards securely organized in all conditions without losing versatility and practicality. You can count on the Contour to exceed expectations as a wallet as well as accomplish tasks, such as opening a bottle, that fall far outside a wallet’s expected functionality. And if you didn’t think titanium and aluminum were strong enough, each wallet has a PVD coating that protects the metal from cosmetic blemishes. Despite the fact that this wallet was clearly designed to take on harsh conditions, Trayvax incorporated high-end components wherever they could.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 3.4 inches long x 2.4 inches wide x 0.5 inches thick</li><li>Capacity: 13 cards, 10 bills</li><li>Material: Top-grain leather; titanium, trass or stainless steel</li><li>Colors: Raw tobacco, stealth black, mississippi mud</li><li>Warranty: 65-year heirloom warranty</li><li>Price: $155</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>One line of free engraving</li><li>Includes a built-in bottle opener, an adjustable money strap, and RFID protection</li><li>Made in the United States</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The skeletal design means that the contents of your wallet will be partially exposed when you take it out of your pocket</li></ul><h3>Best luxury wallet for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Coach 3-in-1 Pebbled Leather Wallet</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best luxury wallet for men</span></p><p><h3 class=title>COACH Men's 3-In-1 Wallet</h3></p><p>If you can’t decide whether you want a full sized bifold or just a cardholder, you may not have to choose. The 3-in-1 Leather Wallet from Coach has a fully removable cardholder that slides into the interior pocket of the bifold when you want maximum storage, or can be removed and used on its own when you want minimal bulk. Of course, you can also use the bifold on its own. There are more than enough options to fit your daily needs, even as they change.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 3.5 inches long x 4.3 inches wide x 0.75 inches thick</li><li>Capacity: 12+ cards & 10+ bills</li><li>Material: Embossed or smooth leather</li><li>Colors: Black, army green, saddle brown, mahogany</li><li>Warranty: 1-year standard warranty</li><li>Price: $225 from <a rel=nofollow href=#>Coach</a> and <a rel=nofollow href=#>Saks Fifth Avenue</a></li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>The ability to interchange the wallet components makes the 3-in-1 quite versatile</li><li>Made with the quality of a recognized brand-name manufacturer, Coach</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The embossed branding option may be too flashy for some; also, when this wallet is fully loaded, it’s definitely on the bulkier side</li></ul><h3>Best designer wallet for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ferragamo Revival Gancini Leather Wallet</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best designer wallet for men</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Gancini wallet with ID window</h3></p><p>Italian luxury fashion brand Salvatore Ferragamo has developed a reputation for producing some of the finest leather goods available for decades, and the Revival Gancini wallet exhibits the brand’s commitment to quality.

Although leather tends to be the most expensive of the three, it’s not necessarily the best. Which material you choose should be dictated by what you want to get out of your wallet, and where you spend most of your time.</p><p><strong>Leather</strong>: This is the most traditional mens wallet material on the market. Leather, and nylon as well, is ideal because it's smooth enough to easily slide in and out of your pockets without catching on anything. Leather also ‘breaks in’ over time, resulting in a smoother, unique finish that represents the different experiences you and your wallet have shared. Leather wallets are also known for durability and longevity, so it’s not unlikely that you and your leather wallet will go through quite a bit together.</p><p>However, leather isn’t water proof and it’s not the thinnest material on the market, especially when it’s high quality. Also, if you want your leather wallet to last as long as possible, you have to properly care for it, which may involve cleaning and polishing a few times a year. These drawbacks may direct you to more rugged materials such as metal or nylon.</p><p><strong>Metal</strong>: Metal wallets are becoming increasingly popular, especially as digital payments become more and more common while cash and coin payments are in <a rel=nofollow href=#>decline</a>. What metal wallets and card holders lack in elegance they make up for in durability and protection. High quality metal wallets tend to be made from strong, lightweight materials like aluminum or titanium.</p><p>Metal outperforms nylon and leather when it comes to physically protecting the contents of the wallet. Not only does the metal offer better protection from drops, the structural rigidity ensures that any documents within, such as checks or tickets, won’t be improperly creased.</p><p><strong>Nylon</strong>: Although nylon isn’t the most luxurious material to choose from, high quality nylon wallets can strike a balance between the look and flexibility of leather with the enhanced durability and practicality of a metal wallet. Nylon is lightweight, thin, flexible, waterproof, and in many cases also slash resistant. Nylon wallets are also quite easy to wash, which makes them ideal for anyone who frequently finds themselves outdoors, for work or for pleasure.</p><p>However, like men’s metal wallets, nylon wallets usually don’t look as sleek or professional as their leather counterparts. On the other hand, this often makes them significantly cheaper. In fact, nylon wallets are likely to be the cheapest of the three.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Before deciding on a new wallet, take into consideration the dimensions of your current wallet. Think about whether you want something larger or smaller. If you have a lot of cards to carry, for example, look for wallets that spread card compartments across the wallet footprint, so you don’t end up with unusually bulky sections where cards are piled on top of one another. On the other hand, if you don’t carry too much, you want to consider a smaller wallet with fewer pockets. Also, keep an eye out for wallets that make the most of their footprint by adding additional features, such as a single card-sized cardholder with an attached money clip for easy cash storage.</p><h3>Capacity</h3><p>Most standard wallets and card holders have space for 7-10 cards, in addition to a small amount of cash. Take stock of what you currently have in your wallet – whether it be old receipts or business cards, chances are you’re carrying around unnecessary items. Once you’re familiar with what’s currently in your wallet, try to get rid of whatever you can. What you’re left with should play a large role in determining what size wallet you get. Best practice is to get a wallet that has slightly more space than what you plan to put in it from the start, so you can add to it as needed.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>While there are countless wallet designs to choose from, there are a few that dominate the market.</p><ul><li><strong>Bi-fold construction</strong>: Without a doubt, this is the most popular shape for a mens wallet. While you won't find many metal wallets in this category, there are a number of leather and nylon options. Bi-fold wallets for men typically contain a cash slot and 4-8 card slots in addition to an ID window. Although bi-folds can be on the slim slide, they definitely aren’t the go-to minimalist option.</li><li>Tri-fold construction: These wallets offer heightened security and storage over their bi-fold peers. The triple folding structure ensures that your wallet is completely sealed on the edges, which adds security and mitigates the risk of losing a loose card. However, tri-fold wallets tend to be bulkier than bi-folds, and they often rely on velcro to stay shut, which isn’t a very durable or elegant clasp material.</li><li><strong>Card holder:</strong> Although it’s not uncommon to see vertical bi-fold wallets advertised as card holders, these wallets don’t typically have any type of fold. Card holders are often the slimmest option, and are ideal for minimalist travelers and consumers who rely on digital payments. Another benefit of card holders is that you truly have the full spectrum of materials to choose from. Not only can you get leather, metal or nylon, there are high-end card holders that make use of multiple materials.</li><li><strong>Money clip:</strong> Don’t let the simplicity of the name fool you, as money clips are actually quite versatile. Ideal for men who subscribe to the age old ‘cash is king’ mentality, money clips offer a slim profile and easy access to your notes. While money clips can be slimmer than card holders in their most pared down form, which consists of the clip and nothing else, they are limited in what, and how much, they can hold. Money clips are also limited in the add-ons they can provide, such as RFID protection.</li><li><strong>Hybrid wallets:</strong> Hybrid wallets combine the best features of different designs to maximize practicality and ease of use. For example, you can choose a bi-fold construction with an internal money clip instead of a cash sleeve to hold your notes. Alternatively, there are tri-fold wallets with removable card holders so you can swap from maximal practicality to sleek minimalism without having to switch wallets. Be on the lookout for high-end hybrid wallets that offer versatility as well as practicality.</li></ul><h3>Security</h3><p>Unlike buying luggage or other accessories where your main concern is durability (and, perhaps, style), you may have to consider the unexpected when it comes to buying a wallet: Can it thwart a criminal from afar? One of the drawbacks of relying on new technologies for payments is the presence of nascent threats to your personal finances. Hackers and other online criminals are constantly looking for new ways to exploit credit cards and other methods of digital finance. Thankfully, the wallet industry has adapted to offer wallets that can mitigate these threats.</p><p>Look for wallets that provide built-in RFID blocking, which prevents those with bad intentions from electronically swiping your credit information as you walk past them. Another great security feature that’s increasingly being incorporated into men’s wallets is built-in tracking ability or a dedicated space for an external tracker, such as an Apple Airtag. If you’ve experienced the sinking feeling of not knowing where your wallet is, you can appreciate the value of being able to track its exact location, even if it’s just lost under a stack of papers on your desk.</p><h2 id=how-we-tested-and-selected-the-best-wallets-for-men>How we tested and selected the best wallets for men</h2><p>We conducted in-depth research into a variety of men’s wallets at differing price points to make sure that we took into consideration as many high quality wallets for men as possible. We accounted for customer satisfaction, specification sheets, third-party reviews, and our own experience to make our selections. All of our recommended wallets have met rigorous criteria for material quality, storage capacity, design, and size. To make the final cuts, we considered additional criteria such as security, versatility and the reputation of the brand for luxury and budget wallets alike.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How much should I spend on a wallet for a man?</h3><p>Depending on the materials you choose, expect to spend between $40-$60 for high-quality, affordable wallets and between $80-$120 for high-end wallets that don’t have a luxury brand name. If you are interested in purchasing a luxury wallet from a famous designer, expect to spend between $250-$500, depending on the size and brand.</p><h3>Are luxury wallets worth it?</h3><p>Thankfully, luxury wallets aren’t the only option to get a high-quality, long-lasting, and good looking wallet. There is an undeniable premium for wallets made by high-end brands, but if you’re willing and able to shell out the cash, you can rest assured knowing that you're investing in something that’s going to last a long time. High quality leather ages beautifully and can last for years, even with consistent heavy use.</p><h3>How can you tell what a quality wallet is?</h3><p>First and foremost, look at the materials. If you are looking at leather wallets, make sure that the leather is genuine and able to be cleaned with standard maintenance. Quality metal wallets, on the other hand, will be made from durable materials such as titanium. The materials are less important for nylon wallets, but high-quality options often offer slash-proof and water resistant fabrics.</p><p>Also, regardless of what material you choose, quality wallets will be thoughtfully designed. For example, it can be tricky to get cards out of a stuffed metal card holder. Top quality wallets will be designed to mitigate issues like this.</p><h3>Do I still require a coin pocket?</h3><p>In all likelihood, no. If you work a job that generates a lot of change, or regularly find yourself dumping large amounts of coins out of your pockets at the end of each day, you might want to consider a coin pouch. However, if you usually pay with a card, or another form of plastic or digital currency, a coin pocket may be bulkier than it is useful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lp5a5rbHTZp2oql2isq97</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-wallet-for-men.html&text=14%20Best%20Wallets%20for%20Men%202024&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-wallet-for-men.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-wallet-for-men.html&title=14%20Best%20Wallets%20for%20Men%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-wallet-for-men.html&title=14%20Best%20Wallets%20for%20Men%202024" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-wallet-for-men.html&title=14%20Best%20Wallets%20for%20Men%202024" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-wallet-for-men.html&description=14%20Best%20Wallets%20for%20Men%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./a-college-student-has-been-charged-with-attempting-to-poison-his-roommate-and.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A college student has been charged with attempting to poison his roommate and targeting him with rac">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./12-dates-of-christmas-hbo-max-love-is-blind-format-1234839192.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="12 Dates of Christmas EP on Creating a Dating Show Out of Holiday Rom-Com Tropes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
