White cleverly imbued Rose with a gullible naïveté, letting her serve as the foil for Dorothy’s barbs and <a href=#>Blanche</a>‘s eye rolls. Whether telling yet another St. Olaf story or doing one of her many selfless deeds, Rose just “wasn’t one to blow [her] own vertubenflugen.” And it was precisely that mix of humility, sweetness and loyalty that endeared her to viewers for decades.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Besides, as Rose admitted, it wasn’t her fault her cousins have been marrying each other for generations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A Beverly Hills High School graduate, White was as savvy in real life as Rose was seemingly dim-witted, and she enjoyed a decades-long career in Hollywood that continued to flourish when so many of her peers found the opportunities disappear when they reached a certain age.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">White<a href=# rel=noopener> started</a> her television career while just a teenager—dancing “the Merry Widow Waltz” on an <a href=#>experimental TV show in 1939, </a>when the medium was still in its infancy—and never really stopped. In fact, she<a href=# rel=noopener> entered the Guinness World Record</a> book in 2014 as the holder for “longest TV career for an entertainer (female).”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/betty-white-obit-01.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a young actress filled with ambition and tenacity, she landed a spot in a Parkay margarine commercial after reportedly hanging around the office of producer Fran Van Hartesveldt until he caved and <a href=# rel=noopener>offered her a job.</a> She later spent six days a week on the Al Jarvis variety show<i> Hollywood on Television</i>. That led to her producing her own sitcom, which she also starred in, called <i>Life With Elizabeth</i>. It was a feat that was as rare then as it is now, and she<a href=# rel=noopener> earned</a> her first Emmy nomination for the work—just two years after the awards show came into existence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Later, she had two versions—one a sitcom, one a talk show—of <i>The Betty White Show, </i>starred in <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i> playing the man-crazy Happy Homemaker Sue Ann Nivens, and was a staple on game shows like <i>Password</i> and <i>Match Game. </i>She also had a chance to work with her future <i>Golden Girls</i> cohorts in the years before the iconic show’s debut, earning a few guest spots on <i>Maude </i>with Bea Arthur, and starring alongside Rue McClanahan in <i>Mama’s Family</i>. White said one of the favorite shows she ever worked on was <a href=# rel=noopener>The <i>Pet Set</i></a>, which she wrote, produced and starred in. She<a href=# rel=noopener> reportedly</a> could feature any creatures she wanted on the show, a huge bonus for the lifelong animal lover and animal welfare advocate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/betty-white-obit-television.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A comedic pioneer, White would have been remembered as an actress who left an indelible impact on her field even without The <i>Golden Girls</i>, but the beloved sitcom earned her new generations of fans who continued to revere White-as-Rose long after the show went off the air in 1992.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The idea for the sitcom came about almost by accident. Executive producers Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas pitched a different show to executives at NBC, who replied that they were interested in a show about women of a certain age. (According to the show’s creators, that “certain age” was “<a href=# rel=noopener>hovering around late 50</a>, early 60s.”) While the character of Dorothy Zbornak was written with Arthur in mind, a casting call went out to figure out who would play her roommates: Southern belle Blanche Devereaux, sassy Sicilian Sophia Petrillo, and wide-eyed Minnesota transplant Rose Nylund.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/betty-white-obit-golden-girls-2.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2010, White<a href=# rel=noopener> told the Associated Press</a> that everyone knew the show was going to be something special when they first read the pilot. “You get a lot of scripts mailed to you and not too many of them are good, but when this one came along it just hit the spot,” she said at the time. She also noted that they initially approached her “with the idea of me doing Blanche.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">White came in and auditioned to play the seductive homeowner, but the director soon had a stroke of brilliance. “When Betty came in, she read the part of Blanche, but [director] Jay Sandrich said, ‘Why have her do Blanche? She already played that character on <i>Mary Tyler Moore.</i> Why not have her be Rose?'” creator Susan Harris<a href=# rel=noopener> told <i>Vulture</i></a> in 2017.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">White played the daft Rose brilliantly, and won her <a href=# rel=noopener>third Primetime Emmy</a> in her very first season portraying the St. Olaf native. <i>The Golden Girls </i>aired on NBC for seven years beginning in 1985, and White was nominated for Outstanding Actress for every year of the show’s run. When the show ended, White continued playing Rose on the spin-off series <i>The Golden Palace, </i>which lasted only one season.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">White was in her early 70s when she said goodbye to Rose for good–but her career was far from finished.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She joined the cast of <i>Bob</i> opposite Bob Newhart in 1993. She later turned what was supposed to be a guest spot on <i>Hot in Cleveland</i> into a full-time gig when she was 88 years old. She also landed guest spots on <i>That 70s Show</i>, <i>Boston Legal</i>, and <i>Bones</i>, and had a memorable turn as “Gammy” in the 2009 rom-com <a href=# rel=noopener>The Proposal</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When <i>Golden Girls </i>went into syndication, and then became available for streaming, White’s understated comedic brilliance was introduced to a new generation—and they loved her. “She is just one of the most spectacular people on the planet,” Junger Witt<a href=# rel=noopener> told <i>Vulture</i></a> in 2017.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Few would disagree.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With a knowing wink, White used her persona as the adorably gullible Rose in later years to shock audiences with unexpectedly bawdy humor. Like when she roasted William Shatner for a Comedy Central special and stunned the audience with<a href=# rel=noopener> her unexpectedly racy speech</a>. Or when she <a href=# rel=noopener>crassly endorsed</a> the <i>Deadpool</i> movie, did<a href=# rel=noopener> vodka shots</a> with David Letterman, or <a href=# rel=noopener>paid tribute</a> to hip hop legend Queen Latifah on VH1’s <i>Hip Hop Honors: All Hail the Queens</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She was so beloved that some determined fans launched a Facebook campaign to convince <i>Saturday Night Live</i> to have White host an episode. The campaign garnered enough traction online that it eventually caught the attention of <i>SNL</i> creator Lorne Michaels, who invited White, then 88, to<a href=#> host the show</a> in May 2010.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite spending decades in front of TV cameras, White<a href=# rel=noopener> claimed</a> she had to battle stage fright while hosting the iconic show. Even so, White won her fifth Primetime Emmy for the gig, and helped <i>SNL </i>earn some of its highest ratings of the season.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">White was honored for her extraordinary career during the <a href=# rel=noopener>70th Emmy Awards</a> in September 2018, where she joked about how long she had been working in Hollywood. “Somebody said something the other day [about how I’m] the first lady of television, and I took it as a big compliment,” White said. “Then I heard her say to her daughter,<i> ‘</i>Yeah, <i>first</i> lady–she’s that old! She was the first one way, way back.'”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But White displayed her gratitude and awe at her long career when accepting her Guinness World Record. “I have no regrets at all,” she said in 2013. “I consider myself to be the luckiest broad on two feet.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/betty-white-obit-golden-girls.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubmFlfXd9jpucraypYsSptdOeZKCnnJmyr3nGoqmlq12Ztqa%2FjHJwaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbetty-white-golden-girls-dies-99.html&text=Betty%20White%20Dies%20at%2099%3a%20How%20%27Golden%20Girls%27%20Made%20Her%20a%20Legend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbetty-white-golden-girls-dies-99.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbetty-white-golden-girls-dies-99.html&title=Betty%20White%20Dies%20at%2099%3a%20How%20%27Golden%20Girls%27%20Made%20Her%20a%20Legend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbetty-white-golden-girls-dies-99.html&title=Betty%20White%20Dies%20at%2099%3a%20How%20%27Golden%20Girls%27%20Made%20Her%20a%20Legend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbetty-white-golden-girls-dies-99.html&title=Betty%20White%20Dies%20at%2099%3a%20How%20%27Golden%20Girls%27%20Made%20Her%20a%20Legend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbetty-white-golden-girls-dies-99.html&description=Betty%20White%20Dies%20at%2099%3a%20How%20%27Golden%20Girls%27%20Made%20Her%20a%20Legend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./comment-distinguer-communication-institutionnelle-et-communication-du-candidat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Comment distinguer communication institutionnelle et communication du candidat ?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./betton-transcrit-des-articles-de-son-bulletin-en-langage-simple-35.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Betton transcrit des articles de son bulletin en langage simple (35)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
