The star was already a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pop-culture sensation</a> by&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;joined the US&nbsp;Army. He&nbsp;had released three studio albums and filmed four movies, including ’Jailhouse Rock’.</p><p>Priscilla first encountered Elvis’ music three years prior, when she was 11&nbsp;and living in&nbsp;West <a href=# title=Germany data-link=tag>Germany</a> with her mother, siblings, and stepfather, who was stationed in&nbsp;the Air Force there.</p><p>In&nbsp;her 1985 essay for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>People</i></a>, Priscilla wrote, «<strong>When we&nbsp;met, I&nbsp;was an&nbsp;impressionable 14-year-old, and he&nbsp;was 24</strong>.» According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;2023 interview with <i>Business Insider</i>, Priscilla described Elvis as&nbsp;«handsomer than he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;films, younger and more vulnerable looking with his&nbsp;GI haircut.»</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that despite being only 14&nbsp;at the time, she felt older in&nbsp;life and that was what attracted her to&nbsp;him.</p><p>Priscilla shared that they first met at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party hosted by&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Elvis’ friends, Currie Grant, who was in&nbsp;the Air Force. This is&nbsp;also why she was able to&nbsp;attend the party in&nbsp;the first place.</p><p>In&nbsp;March 1960, Elvis left Germany and returned to&nbsp;the&nbsp;US after spending several months with Priscilla. Of&nbsp;the night before Elvis went back to&nbsp;the US, Priscilla wrote for <i>People</i> in&nbsp;1985, «It&nbsp;was March&nbsp;1, 1960, the night before Elvis was to&nbsp;leave Germany to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;the States. We&nbsp;were lying on&nbsp;his bed, our arms around each other. I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;state of&nbsp;complete despair.»</p><p>Priscilla was wondering if&nbsp;she would ever see him again or&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;his arms the way she had been nearly every night for the past six months. «I&nbsp;could not bear the thought of&nbsp;the night ending and&nbsp;us saying goodbye for what&nbsp;I thought would be&nbsp;the last time. I&nbsp;wept and wept,» she continued. «For the two days after Elvis left, I&nbsp;locked myself in&nbsp;my&nbsp;room, unable to&nbsp;eat, unable to&nbsp;sleep.»</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;June 2022 video for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Vogue</i></a>, Priscilla reminisced on&nbsp;the outfit (pictured above) she wore to&nbsp;say goodbye to&nbsp;Elvis. «One request that he&nbsp;asked, that&nbsp;I not be&nbsp;teary-eyed. So, you see me&nbsp;smiling here. There are other pictures where I&nbsp;am down and looking away,» she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/089/3c2/d0fa8f5a0e929b2a8887e70b39.png><p>In&nbsp;the summer of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1962</a>, Priscilla’s parents kindly allowed her to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;two-week visit to&nbsp;Elvis, who she was very excited to&nbsp;see. At&nbsp;the last minute, they decided to&nbsp;travel to&nbsp;Las Vegas instead of&nbsp;the previously agreed upon location of&nbsp;Los Angeles.</p><p>«My&nbsp;parents became confused and bewildered by&nbsp;our relationship. We&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;make them believe that it&nbsp;was proper and platonic, and they wanted to&nbsp;believe&nbsp;me. Whenever they tried to&nbsp;stop&nbsp;us from seeing each other, I&nbsp;pleaded and cried and made them and myself miserable. In&nbsp;retrospect, I&nbsp;don’t think anything could have stopped me&nbsp;from seeing Elvis,» Priscilla wrote in&nbsp;<i>People</i> in&nbsp;1985.</p><p>When the idea of&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip was brought&nbsp;up, Priscilla’s father requested that they wait until she was on&nbsp;summer vacation. He&nbsp;also asked that Elvis send her a&nbsp;first-class round-trip ticket, provide an&nbsp;itinerary of&nbsp;her daily activities for the two weeks she’d be&nbsp;in&nbsp;Los Angeles, ensure that she was constantly chaperoned, and that she write her parents every day. Elvis agreed to&nbsp;all these requests, and Priscilla made the trip.</p><p>However, Elvis and Priscilla ended up&nbsp;traveling to&nbsp;Las Vegas the next day. She even pre-wrote letters from Los Angeles to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sent every day while she was in&nbsp;Vegas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ce/4b8/3e14d95e329624b2e2c28a9525.jpg><p>They would occasionally reunite when Elvis invited her to&nbsp;the United States. This went on&nbsp;for several years before they eventually got married. Those years left <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Priscilla</a> feeling as&nbsp;if&nbsp;time stood still as&nbsp;she eagerly awaited Elvis’s sporadic calls and counted down the days until their next meeting. During this time, she couldn’t escape the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rumors</a> circulating about Elvis’s romantic involvements with other women, ranging from neighbors to&nbsp;celebrities.</p><p>Elvis proposed to&nbsp;Priscilla in&nbsp;1966, and they exchanged vows in&nbsp;Las Vegas on&nbsp;May&nbsp;1, 1967. «It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;surprise,» she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. «He&nbsp;got on&nbsp;his knee with a&nbsp;gift behind his back and told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;close my&nbsp;eyes. Of&nbsp;which&nbsp;I did and then told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;open them, and he&nbsp;presented me&nbsp;with a&nbsp;beautiful engagement ring.»</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;1973 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with <i>Ladies Home Journal</i>, Priscilla explained that she hadn’t really wanted to&nbsp;get married, but society expected&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/83b/0c7/eea20a5aa09b8f44fff412b4ee.jpg><p>«Even though we&nbsp;were perfectly content the way we&nbsp;were, at&nbsp;that time it&nbsp;wasn’t nice for people to&nbsp;live together,» she reflected.</p><p>It’s clear that Elvis <a href=# title=loved data-link=tag>loved</a> Priscilla very much, and he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wanted</a> to&nbsp;make her his wife, despite the potential scandal. Over time, Priscilla underwent some changes to&nbsp;become the perfect partner for Elvis. She even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> herself as&nbsp;«<strong>Elvis’s living doll</strong>.»</p><p>These changes included getting porcelain dental caps, refining her posture, dyeing her hair black, and styling it&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;updo to&nbsp;match the image of&nbsp;the King.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa6/b1c/a9f3db51e0a9902d806b14e8da.jpg><p>Their only daughter, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lisa Marie</a>, was born nine months to&nbsp;the day after their wedding. «On&nbsp;February&nbsp;1, 1968, I&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;at&nbsp;about eight o’clock and realized that labor had begun,» Priscilla told the <i>Orlando Sentinel</i> in&nbsp;1985. «Our daughter, Lisa Marie, was born at&nbsp;5:01 that afternoon.»</p><p>«Elvis came into the room and kissed&nbsp;me, thrilled that we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;perfectly normal, healthy baby. He&nbsp;was already in&nbsp;love with her. He&nbsp;watched me&nbsp;holding her and his eyes misted with happiness. Then he&nbsp;took&nbsp;us both in&nbsp;his arms and held&nbsp;us,» she said.</p><p>«The man in&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a> room that day was the man&nbsp;I loved and will always love. He&nbsp;didn’t have to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;strong and decisive or&nbsp;sexy; he&nbsp;wasn’t afraid to&nbsp;show his warmth or&nbsp;vulnerability. He&nbsp;didn’t have to&nbsp;act the part of&nbsp;Elvis Presley, superstar. He&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;man, my&nbsp;husband,» Priscilla added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bdc/303/23a4fa544e9b9158fb68886865.png><p>However, Priscilla felt Elvis’ interest in&nbsp;her waned after she became a&nbsp;mother. Much like before their <a href=#>marriage</a>, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued</a> to&nbsp;have romantic entanglements with other women. Priscilla frequently discovered love letters addressed to&nbsp;her husband. Over time, she had the realization that she could no&nbsp;longer wait at&nbsp;home for him.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, «My&nbsp;life was his life. He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy. My&nbsp;problems were secondary. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;grow. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things.»</p><p>The pressure to&nbsp;live up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her husband’s expectations tired Priscilla. She openly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that she never appeared before him without <a href=#>makeup</a> and never dressed in&nbsp;his presence because he&nbsp;preferred to&nbsp;see the finished look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a1d/abf/872ad45efbb6f571ab58864ad9.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1972, Priscilla <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>informed</a> Elvis of&nbsp;her decision to&nbsp;leave him. This led to&nbsp;their subsequent divorce and a&nbsp;joint custody arrangement for their daughter. Priscilla blossomed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=newly data-link=tag>newly</a> single woman. She worked to&nbsp;take control of&nbsp;her own life.</p><p>Meanwhile, Elvis <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>struggled</a> with financial problems. He&nbsp;had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>several</a> romantic relationships and even proposed to&nbsp;Ginger Alden after his divorce from Priscilla. However, they never planned to&nbsp;get married. Tragically, Elvis was found dead on&nbsp;August&nbsp;16, 1977. He&nbsp;was 42&nbsp;years old.</p><p>Priscilla was devastated by&nbsp;the news and found it&nbsp;almost impossible to&nbsp;accept. She had hoped that Elvis would have taken refuge in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hospital, hidden away from the public eye for a&nbsp;while, and that he&nbsp;would return at&nbsp;some point. She later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, «It&nbsp;was shocking.

She fondly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a> how he&nbsp;would reach out to&nbsp;her to&nbsp;share his troubles; each call was a&nbsp;treasured moment for her. After her divorce, Priscilla embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress and a&nbsp;successful businesswoman. Although she never remarried, she did have a&nbsp;long-term relationship. This resulted in&nbsp;the birth of&nbsp;her son, Navarone.</p><p>Priscilla opened Graceland to&nbsp;tourists. She did this to&nbsp;preserve the legacy of&nbsp;the home they once shared as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. In&nbsp;this way, she was able to&nbsp;pay taxes and bills without the need for a&nbsp;sale of&nbsp;the cherished property.</p><p>Graceland has since become the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>second most visited</a> residence in&nbsp;the United States, trailing only the White House in&nbsp;popularity.
