While chairing the House Ways and Means Committee, he lent his name to the Underwood Tariff of 1913, the first significant tariff reform since the Civil War. Designed to bolster international trade, it “broke 52 years of Republican protectionism and provided for the first Federal income tax levied under the new ratified 16th Amendment,” <a href=# rel=noopener>according to</a> a history of the committee. In Congress, he was known for supporting states’ rights, and the <a href=# rel=noopener>League of Nations,</a> but he turned down the opportunity to <a href=# rel=noopener>run to be Woodrow Wilson’s vice president</a> in 1912 (an office he probably would have won, TIME suggested in 1925). He was elected to the Senate in <a href=# rel=noopener>1914</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His views on social issues set up him to fight for his life in the election of 1920.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He opposed women’s suffrage, organized labor and the Ku Klux Klan, and was known as a “moist” or “wet” conservative Democrat, meaning he was against prohibition. By today’s standards, he might be considered a Libertarian, according to Wayne Flynt, a historian whose 2016 Southern Religion and Christian Diversity in the Twentieth Century has a chapter on Underwood’s 1920 Senate reelection campaign. Issues like suffrage and prohibition, as <a href=#>TIME</a> once summed up in describing Underwood’s political views, seemed to share “lofty purpose, great zeal, and not a little oratory” but Underwood saw “something dangerous in them all.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He barely won re-election because so many people who supported those issues came out to vote against him. “Alabama was the largest manufacturing state in the South and had the largest union membership at the time,” Flynt explains, and those same people were often both prohibitionists and Klan members. “And he hadn’t counted on the 19th amendment passing, and so a huge influx of women turned out against him.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His personality is thought to have gotten in the way too because, unlike the fictional Underwood, he didn’t have the charisma and ability to make connections with working-class people. “He was not very affable man, and that’s another reason he nearly lost,” Flynt says. He also supported poll taxes and other voter-suppression methods designed to keep working-class whites and African-Americans from voting, so he didn’t think it would matter whether they liked him or not.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though he did win reelection in the end, Flynt notes that he was “damaged goods” after barely carrying his home state, which took “a lot of the luster off of his reputation as someone who would sweep the South.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yet, like the fictional Underwood, he aspired to higher office — meaning the highest office — no matter. He decided to run for president in 1924, noting in a speech that he was “going to give the South a chance to select a Southern man to carry the banner of Democracy.” He earned household-name recognition for being one of the key players in the longest-running national political party convention in U.S. history, during which the Alabama delegation put 24 votes toward his candidacy during each and every one of the 103 ballots. Still, the Democratic Party’s nomination went to someone else, John W. Davis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And, while the fictional <a href=# rel=noopener>Frank Underwood’s father’s ties to the KKK</a> threaten his presidential campaign in House of Cards, <a href=# rel=noopener>historians say</a> that Oscar Underwood’s failure to be nominated can be traced to his denouncement of the KKK, which ended up costing him Southern support. “Although the Klan ridiculed Underwood as the ‘Jew, jug, and Jesuit’ candidate, the national press extolled his statesmanship, tolerance, and courage,” according to Flynt’s book <a href=# rel=noopener>Alabama in the Twentieth Century</a>. After that drama, he lost his seat in the Senate too.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though never president, he died in 1929 at a residence fit for a president: Woodlawn Plantation in Virginia, which was once owned by George Washington.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Political scientists argue</a>, however, that — minus the corruption — the fictional Underwood’s path to the presidency doesn’t resemble the real Underwood’s career so much as that of Gerald Ford, who became President without ever having been elected to the White House.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtb2lohnqEjp%2BpmqabYry0r8CrZK6mlJq%2FuLvOnWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffrank-oscar-underwood.html&text=House%20of%20CardsWhy%20the%20Real%20Underwood%20Never%20Became%20President&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrank-oscar-underwood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrank-oscar-underwood.html&title=House%20of%20CardsWhy%20the%20Real%20Underwood%20Never%20Became%20President" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffrank-oscar-underwood.html&title=House%20of%20CardsWhy%20the%20Real%20Underwood%20Never%20Became%20President" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffrank-oscar-underwood.html&title=House%20of%20CardsWhy%20the%20Real%20Underwood%20Never%20Became%20President" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrank-oscar-underwood.html&description=House%20of%20CardsWhy%20the%20Real%20Underwood%20Never%20Became%20President" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jenna-ortega.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jenna Ortega (Actress) - On This Day">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./holiday-2024-retail-shopping-trends-predictions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Holiday 2024 Shopping Trends: What Retailers Can Expect">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
