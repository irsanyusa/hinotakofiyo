He&nbsp;was given for adoption by&nbsp;his mom, who had him at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age. Now, years passed, and the man sees his biological mom every day, and he&nbsp;feels that he&nbsp;loves her with all his heart. He&nbsp;has now made a&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;open up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her, and posted an&nbsp;update about the most dramatic and very emotional event in&nbsp;his life.</p><p><h2>The man came to&nbsp;a&nbsp;social network to&nbsp;tell people about his life dilemma.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/299/3ec/42fce65b8eb58f1da6a76855f1.jpg><p>A&nbsp;man under a&nbsp;nickname <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nodinnerinvite</a> came to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;tell his life <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a>, which could certainly be&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspiration for some drama movie. He&nbsp;wrote that he’s now 24&nbsp;years old and in&nbsp;his <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> he&nbsp;was given up&nbsp;for adoption. His mom had him when she was 14. His parents told him about his bio mother when he&nbsp;was growing&nbsp;up. The man revealed that he&nbsp;still has the letter she wrote him that she asked if&nbsp;they could give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;him if&nbsp;they wanted.</p><p>The man admitted it&nbsp;was crazy reading it&nbsp;sometimes and knowing it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;literal <a href=# title=child data-link=tag>child</a> who wrote&nbsp;it, saying she’s sorry she couldn’t be&nbsp;his mommy, but she hopes her son is&nbsp;happy. She was open to&nbsp;having contact, but the man’s family moved for his adoptive dad’s job when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;11, and then it&nbsp;seemed impossible to&nbsp;find her.</p><p>But luckily he&nbsp;did.</p><p><h2>The adopted child is&nbsp;now all grown up&nbsp;and has a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;see his mom.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c65/478/e0948659409b02c7ceaa0cbd0b.jpg><p>The man <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> that now his mom is&nbsp;working at&nbsp;a&nbsp;small restaurant, and he&nbsp;keeps going, but she doesn’t know it’s him. They even talk sometimes. And she seems like a&nbsp;nice lady to&nbsp;him. Sometimes, when she says something like “do&nbsp;you want a&nbsp;refill, honey” or&nbsp;uses another term like that, he&nbsp;very much wants to&nbsp;tell her. The man revealed that the whole situation makes him nervous. When they happen to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;talk, she seems really genuine.</p><p>The man wrote that if&nbsp;it’s not super busy, she’s more open to&nbsp;talking about random stuff. And he&nbsp;literally drives 2&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;come eat at&nbsp;this place just to&nbsp;see her. And it’s like she knows him already because he’s there once or&nbsp;2&nbsp;times a&nbsp;week for the past 3&nbsp;months so&nbsp;she always says hi&nbsp;with a&nbsp;big smile.</p><p>And then the man writes, “But man, if&nbsp;only she knew.”</p><p><h2>Inspired by&nbsp;people on&nbsp;Reddit, the man made a&nbsp;crucial decision.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc4/9e4/4ff28658e2957ec1a87f697508.jpg><p>One day, the man <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> his mother all the <a href=# title=truth data-link=tag>truth</a>. And for him, it&nbsp;was pretty heavy. He&nbsp;wrote, “My&nbsp;heart was even beating fast. I&nbsp;kept trying to&nbsp;think how to&nbsp;tell her. Many of&nbsp;the comments on&nbsp;my&nbsp;last post here mentioned writing her a&nbsp;letter, just how she wrote a&nbsp;letter for&nbsp;me. Originally that was the plan, but for&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;felt like&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;say&nbsp;it.”</p><p>He&nbsp;waited for his mother to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done with her shift and that was when they were closing the restaurant already. And waited in&nbsp;the parking lot. They said hi&nbsp;when she saw him first, but then he&nbsp;told her there was something serious that she needed to&nbsp;know. First told her sorry for keeping it&nbsp;from her this long. She didn’t react until he&nbsp;actually pulled out her letter.</p><p>The man described his mother’s reaction, writing, “And she started bawling from there. Like screaming and crying at&nbsp;the same time, and didn’t even have to&nbsp;finish the whole ‘I’m your son’ speech. She just saw it&nbsp;and knew. It&nbsp;was crazy. Next thing I&nbsp;know, she’s hugging me&nbsp;instantly, but then she pulled back and asked if&nbsp;it’s okay to&nbsp;hug&nbsp;me. Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;is, and we’re just there hugging and crying in&nbsp;the parking lot. It&nbsp;hit her hard, though. Her legs gave out for a&nbsp;second, so&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;actually hold her up&nbsp;while she’s still hugging me&nbsp;for a&nbsp;min.”</p><p>What really got him was her saying to&nbsp;him, “look how big you got.” Also, hearing her cry made him cry too. She went back to&nbsp;open the restaurant&nbsp;up (she wouldn’t take no&nbsp;for an&nbsp;answer) and they had <a href=# title=coffee data-link=tag>coffee</a>, ate a&nbsp;slice of&nbsp;their pie inside and talked. The man wrote, “Soooo much stuff we&nbsp;talked about. She told me&nbsp;the second time&nbsp;I came to&nbsp;the restaurant she got a&nbsp;feeling, but for her, it&nbsp;was hard to&nbsp;believe it&nbsp;was&nbsp;me. So&nbsp;that feeling she had was pushed way down.”</p><p><h2>The man’s mom told him the whole story and it&nbsp;shook him to&nbsp;the core.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/beb/79b/38bfd95c2eb026787b04336ed3.jpg><p>The man’s mom told him he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>looked</a> much like his biological dad when he&nbsp;was younger, though. She stayed in&nbsp;contact with his dad in&nbsp;case he&nbsp;ever reached out to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them so&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;contact the other. She told him about how they wanted to&nbsp;keep him. Especially his biological dad, he&nbsp;didn’t want him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;adopted. But he&nbsp;knew they had to&nbsp;because they were just kids. It&nbsp;took him a&nbsp;long time to&nbsp;get past it&nbsp;after he&nbsp;was born. That’s why he&nbsp;didn’t leave anything because he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;believe he&nbsp;might not see his kid again.</p><p>The man wrote that his mom wanted to&nbsp;know everything about him, but her main thing was if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was happy and if&nbsp;his parents were good to&nbsp;him. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;happy childhood. The man told her thank you for helping to&nbsp;give him this life, and they both cried again. She cried the most. Everything was very emotional for her. Sometimes she would look really happy, but then get sad again.</p><p>After his 18th birthday, she was hoping he&nbsp;would find her, that’s why she stayed in&nbsp;the same city. But since he&nbsp;didn’t she always thought maybe he&nbsp;resented her, wasn’t told he’s adopted, or&nbsp;maybe had decided it&nbsp;was better not to&nbsp;have her around. It&nbsp;made the man feel bad for not telling her sooner. She asked him if&nbsp;they could have dinner soon to&nbsp;keep talking. And if&nbsp;at&nbsp;some point in&nbsp;the future if&nbsp;he’s interested, come over to&nbsp;her house so&nbsp;he&nbsp;can meet her husband.</p><p>They exchanged numbers. After he&nbsp;left, she sent a&nbsp;text telling him thank you for giving her this gift that she didn’t know if&nbsp;it&nbsp;would ever come.</p><p>And here’s yet a&nbsp;more dramatic family <a href=# title=story data-link=tag>story</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man who found out that most of&nbsp;his kids are actually not his <a href=#>biological children</a>, and the decision he&nbsp;made was very tough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZut8Spq2allZrBqrrGZqSyZZKev7W0jKampmWSqsFuv8eeZJ2hlKPBbrfNqK5moaSoeq6xjKJkn6GelrmtxYydnJyhlJqxbsDOZqapnZ5iwrF506hkoZ2iYoVyg5NyaWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fi-kept-meeting-my-birth-mom-but-she-didnt-know-its-me-i-finally-decided-to-open-up-to-her-817492.html&text=I%20Kept%20Meeting%20My%20Birth%20Mom%2c%20but%20She%20Didnt%20Know%20Its%20Me%2c%20I%20Finally%20Decided%20to%20Open%20Up%20to%20Her&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-kept-meeting-my-birth-mom-but-she-didnt-know-its-me-i-finally-decided-to-open-up-to-her-817492.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-kept-meeting-my-birth-mom-but-she-didnt-know-its-me-i-finally-decided-to-open-up-to-her-817492.html&title=I%20Kept%20Meeting%20My%20Birth%20Mom%2c%20but%20She%20Didnt%20Know%20Its%20Me%2c%20I%20Finally%20Decided%20to%20Open%20Up%20to%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fi-kept-meeting-my-birth-mom-but-she-didnt-know-its-me-i-finally-decided-to-open-up-to-her-817492.html&title=I%20Kept%20Meeting%20My%20Birth%20Mom%2c%20but%20She%20Didnt%20Know%20Its%20Me%2c%20I%20Finally%20Decided%20to%20Open%20Up%20to%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fi-kept-meeting-my-birth-mom-but-she-didnt-know-its-me-i-finally-decided-to-open-up-to-her-817492.html&title=I%20Kept%20Meeting%20My%20Birth%20Mom%2c%20but%20She%20Didnt%20Know%20Its%20Me%2c%20I%20Finally%20Decided%20to%20Open%20Up%20to%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-kept-meeting-my-birth-mom-but-she-didnt-know-its-me-i-finally-decided-to-open-up-to-her-817492.html&description=I%20Kept%20Meeting%20My%20Birth%20Mom%2c%20but%20She%20Didnt%20Know%20Its%20Me%2c%20I%20Finally%20Decided%20to%20Open%20Up%20to%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./0-28804-1956922-1956921-1956897-00-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelangelo's Piet - Top 10 Art Accidents">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fangoria-horror-film-production-through-the-lens-entertainment-1236089748.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fangoria, Famed Horror Magazine, Leaps Back Into Movie Production With Through the Lens, Ito J">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
