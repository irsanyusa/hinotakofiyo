In the evening, the public was able to pay their respects as her remains lay in repose at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Nov. 28, dignitaries including all the living U.S. first ladies and multiple presidents attended a memorial service in Atlanta, Ga. celebrating the former first Lady’s life.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Who attended the memorial service?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Former president Jimmy Carter, 99, traveled to Atlanta from his home in Plains, Ga., where he is currently receiving hospice care, to attend his wife’s <a href=#>memorial service</a> on Emory University’s campus.

The service included some of her favorite Scripture passages and songs, including “America the Beautiful,” the Christian hymns “Blessed Assurance,” “Morning Has Broken,” “Great is Thy Faithfulness,” “What Wondrous Love Is This” and “Let There Be Peace on Earth,” as well as John Lennon’s “Imagine,” <a href=#>performed by country music stars </a>Trisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks. &nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Carters’ children and grandchildren, longtime aide and friend Kathryn Cade and journalist Judy Woodruff gave tributes.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her son, James Earl “Chip” Carter III, said his mother was the “glue” that held the family together and credited her for helping him get into treatment for drug and alcohol addiction. “She saved my life,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her daughter, Amy Carter, said her mother’s partnership and love story with her father was a defining feature of their lives. Speaking on behalf of her father, she read a letter Jimmy wrote to Rosalynn 75 years ago while he was serving in the U.S. Navy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“My darling, every time I have ever been away from you I have been thrilled to return to discover just how wonderful you are,” the letter read. “When I see you, I fall in love with you all over again.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What happened at the funeral?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tuesday’s memorial service was followed by a funeral on Wednesday in Plains, Ga., the tiny town where Rosalynn Carter was born and lived for most of her life with Jimmy Carter.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mourners <a href=#>lined the streets</a> as the motorcade traveled from the family’s home to their church to say goodbye, passing tributes to the “First Lady of Plains.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her husband also attended the intimate, invitation-only funeral inside Maranatha Baptist Church on Wednesday, silent and in his wheelchair. The church, <a href=#>where Jimmy Carter taught Sunday school for years</a>, hosts a wooden cross he made.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The former president and some other family members <a href=#>wore leis around their necks,</a> while others donned Hawaiian shirts, a nod to Rosalynn Carter’s love for Hawaii when the couple lived there while Jimmy Carter was in the Navy.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other attendees included church members and close friends. Several of Carter’s children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren spoke at the service. The couple’s grandson Josh Carter, who spoke on behalf of his father, the Carters' youngest son, called his grandmother "kind, loving and caring" and said she "was happiest whenever there was a new baby,” <a href=#>USA Today reported.&nbsp;</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maranatha Pastor Tony Lowden, the couple’s longtime friend and minister who officiated both services, on Wednesday paid tribute to “the life and legacy of the greatest first lady,” <a href=#>the Associated Press reported</a>. Lowden added that nobody––either on the political right or the left––could find anything bad to say about Rosalynn Carter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The funeral program <a href=#>featured more Scripture readings </a>by some of her great-grandchildren, a musical rendition of “The Lord’s Prayer” by actress and singer Joanna Maddox, a performance from the Georgia Southwestern State University Concert Choir and the congregation joining together to sing “Amazing Grace,” <a href=#>the Washington Post</a> reported.
