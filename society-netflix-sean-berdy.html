But Sam, a deaf teenager played by Sean Berdy, is not one of them: after the town’s parents disappear, he acts as a steady moral center as the community around him descends into ruthlessness and egotism.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Berdy, 25, spent five seasons playing the teen heartthrob <a href=# rel=noopener>Emmett Bledsoe</a> in the Freeform family drama <i>Switched At Birth</i>. During that run he became a prominent face of an ASL (American Sign Language) community hungering for representation. But in 2018, he announced that was stepping away from acting due to his struggles with bipolar disorder. “I may look like the happiest and silliest man on earth, but that is an artist’s art of hiding,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote on Instagram</a>. “I have been hiding for so long and I’m done with it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>The Society </i>marks Berdy’s first major role since his hiatus. In a phone interview conducted with the assistance of an interpreter, Berdy talked about returning to acting, the atmosphere on set and the increasing visibility of the ASL community in film and TV.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>What parts of </b><b><i>The Society</i></b><b> feel most similar to our own society?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The society in the show is actually based heavily on the politics of today. We have this gun violence epidemic, we have domestic violence increasing. We have social justice and the hate for socialism. I think the creators tried to include a lot of those issues to bring the story to life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Last year you wrote on Instagram about your struggles with bipolar disorder. What have the last few years been like for you?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To be honest, I had hidden my struggle with my bipolar situation for over a good 14 years, I would say. It is a battle from from the moment I wake up until the end of the day. It feels like you’re in a bubble at times and you’re trying to get out. You stretch the bubble and want to break out of it—but you’re back inside and in the darkness at the end of the day. That has been difficult for me. I am very fortunate to have my family who’s supported me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>How did you decide you were ready to return to acting?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I think acting is in my blood—I am always ready to perform when I feel it. I took a good three years to focus on myself.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I guess you don’t really know when the time is right until the material presents itself. This script came to me, and therefore the time was right. When I read the script, I thought, “Wow, This is different. This is a story that is going to be a big hit once it goes out into the world.” I believe that.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">My struggle has been up and down. It’s a situation where I live day to day. But with a daily focus and working with such a great cast and crew who supports me, they understand that some days aren’t the best for me and they’re there for me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>You’ve <a href=# rel=noopener>described your character</a> on Switched at Birth as the “deaf James Dean.” How is your new character, Sam, different?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sam is very aware of the fact he’s always been different from everyone where he grew up. He’s the only deaf guy in a hearing family. He thinks outside of the box, and really cares about people more than he cares about himself, in many ways.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b><i>The Society </i></b><b>is unique in that virtually all of its characters are teenagers. What was it like filming with a cast of of exclusively young actors?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We were all meeting at this place for the first time and learning how to be a family. We were away together for four months filming these ten episodes that had all these heavy emotional scenes and required a lot of mental preparation. That helped us get closer quicker.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We would eat dinner together. We would have house parties. We had a lot of fun while working very hard. We spent four months away on the East coast, shooting in 20-degree weather with the wind chill factor making it maybe 10 degrees. We were wearing parkas. We had to rent a charter bus to sit on with the heater between takes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was a lot of fun, and we do feel like a family. Chris [Keyser, the show’s creator] and the producers have given us these opportunities to run wild, to be creative with our characters. They believe in us. This show is a heavy show. We’re putting all of our emotions out there and giving it our all.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The house parties on the show are pretty crazy. How did the ones in real life compare?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those parties were pretty tame: board games, spaghetti dinners, or we’d order Chinese takeout. They were very traditionally oriented and warm gatherings, as opposed to the show, where you’d have these wild get-downs. In the first episode, we’re partying in a church—that’s about as wild as it gets. It’s probably about as wild a scene as I had ever filmed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Your character mostly communicates with the other characters using American Sign Language. Did the other actors know how to sign before the show started?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They literally knew not one sign. We had an ASL coach on set who was responsible for teaching the lines in sign language to the cast. They had to have lessons during their free time and sometimes had to work extra over the weekends. I’m so proud of the cast—It’s not easy and they’re doing a great job on the show.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I admire Gideon [Adlon, who plays Becca] so much. She showed up cold and impressed me with how motivated she was to learn the language. Basically for each episode, she had a week-and-a-half or two weeks max to learn all her lines in sign language believably. That’s a lot of pressure—and she nailed it every time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>How did you draw on your own experiences with deafness to inform this character?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sam’s story doesn’t exactly parallel my life because I’ve always been able to hear a little bit. I love music. I consider myself bilingual: my first language is ASL but I do have the ability to speak.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Has ASL visibility increased in Hollywood since you started your career?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I can say that Hollywood has recognized ASL finally. Two recent movies, <a href=#><i>The Shape of Water </i></a>and <a href=#><i>A Quiet Place</i></a>, were both beautiful movies featuring sign language in different ways.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In fact, I’m writing a movie right now that uses ASL. It’s a love story, and I hope to go into production in the next couple years. ASL is hot right now—but it’s my life language and it’s a beautiful language.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>We have seen teenagers stepping up and becoming activists for change regarding issues like gun violence and climate change. What impact can teens have on the discourse?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For young people, this world is just getting crazier and crazier. It’s very hard for me emotionally, personally, to see things that are happening the world right now. I hope this show speaks for itself and illuminates what’s happening and helps the audience see we need to take care of some issues. I think that young people can inspire the world by sharing the message of love.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>How would you fare in the world of </b><b><i>The Society</i></b><b>?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’d lead. I’d jump right in and take a lead position, simple as that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWhsgHmCjqymnKGVqcZuusStnaWhqGLApq3NZpmeqpSufA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsociety-netflix-sean-berdy.html&text=Sean%20Berdy%20on%20Deaf%20Representation%20and%20Netflix%27s%20The%20Society&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsociety-netflix-sean-berdy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsociety-netflix-sean-berdy.html&title=Sean%20Berdy%20on%20Deaf%20Representation%20and%20Netflix%27s%20The%20Society" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsociety-netflix-sean-berdy.html&title=Sean%20Berdy%20on%20Deaf%20Representation%20and%20Netflix%27s%20The%20Society" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsociety-netflix-sean-berdy.html&title=Sean%20Berdy%20on%20Deaf%20Representation%20and%20Netflix%27s%20The%20Society" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsociety-netflix-sean-berdy.html&description=Sean%20Berdy%20on%20Deaf%20Representation%20and%20Netflix%27s%20The%20Society" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-bella-twins-prank-the-agt-judges-with-onstage-fight.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Bella Twins Prank the 'AGT' Judges with Onstage Fight">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./quiz-are-you-in-a-cultural-bubble.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Quiz: Are You in a Cultural Bubble?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
