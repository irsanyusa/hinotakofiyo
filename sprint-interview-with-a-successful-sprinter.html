Who could answer this question better than someone who has successfully finished it? We talked to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leah Wei</a>, who graduated with an Honours Degree in Design after studying at York University and Bauhaus Universität, Leah is now focusing full-time on growing her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>. Using her creative background in branding, UX, illustration, and modelling, Leah creates beautiful content. Curious by nature and adventurous in spirit, she’s always filled with new ideas and interests. Her dream is to build a nomadic lifestyle to soak in all that the world has to offer. We at Lingoda have been partnering with her since May 2020 and we are so excited that she finished our French language Sprint last year and that we could support her lead a remote lifestyle with our flexible online classes.<br></p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><br>Leah, thank you so much for interviewing with us today. When did you take the Lingoda Sprint and which language did you learn? Which level did you get to?</h3><p>I took my first Sprint Summer of 2020. It was a Super Sprint but I wanted to take it casually and have fun so I jumped around different classes and levels but ultimately ended up in B2.2!<br>My second sprint was a regular Sprint in the Spring of 2021 but funnily enough I found it easier doing the Super Sprint since I never needed to remember which dates I had class because I had one everyday! It became a daily habit that was like muscle memory.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What was your motivation to sign up?</h3><p>I had just graduated from design school and had no idea what I wanted to do next. I’d always been interested in languages but hadn’t gotten the time to really dive into it. When I first saw Lingoda’s sprint format, I felt really inspired to sign-up. It felt like an all-or-nothing challenge (which it really isn’t – you learn so much whether or not you win!) I was planning to move to Montréal in the Fall and I also had family in France so I figured improving my French would be a great place to start on re-starting my language journey.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What kept you motivated throughout the Sprint?</h3><p>I really fell for the challenge format! Consistency had always been a struggle for me so having a program that incentivized me to study daily with a cashback reward kept me extremely motivated, more so than I did at school since I would often show up late haha… It was only an hour a day so it also felt very feasible. And being online, I could roll out of bed and to my computer in one swift movement!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Where did you take your Lingoda classes and at what time of day?</h3><p>My summer schedule was super unstructured and all over the place. Some days I would hangout with friends, other days I would visit my parents or stay home all day so I really appreciated being able to choose whether I would take the classes in the morning, afternoon, or right before bed. I usually booked my class a day or two in advance, sometimes even day of (I wasn’t picky with what courses or levels were available.)</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>“After successfully completing the Lingoda Language Sprint I felt…”</h3><p>…really proud of myself! I proved to myself, with enough drive and persistence I could show up for myself every single day to keep improving a part of me! I’m the type of person to set a New Year’s resolution and forget about it two weeks in so this was a big accomplishment for me.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Since taking the Sprint, how have you used your new language skills?</h3><p>After completing my Sprint, I moved to Montréal and have been using my language skills around the city and practicing with friends. I think it’s important to make an effort to learn the language of the place you move to, even if it’s not perfect, the gesture will always be appreciated by others.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What’s been your proudest moment using your new language?</h3><p>My proudest moment would have to be filming vlogs in French on my channel! I used to feel shy speaking French but Lingoda really helped boost my confidence and now I can film entire YouTube videos in French, expressing my feelings and taking viewers throughout my day whether I’m at home, with friends, or creating in the studio!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>If you could give one tip to people who want to complete the Sprint successfully, what would it be?</h3><p>Set an alarm (or two!) 10 minutes before every single class you take. I knew forgetting a class would potentially be the biggest challenge since my mind is usually all over the place. Of course, everyone is different so read through the Sprint rules document very carefully, taking special care to note down the areas you think you could possibly fall through on.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What would you say to someone who is nervous to start the Sprint?</h3><p>Just do it! Make a list of your language goals, why you’re learning it, and just jump in! It’s always the first step that’s the hardest but the decisions we make in the moment have an immense impact on our future. Just by signing up for a 3-month learning experience, you could be moving towards a more adventurous, cultured and connected future for yourself 🙂</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Lingoda Team</h2><p>This article was produced by one of the in-house Lingoda writers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57waWmoGeVo3y0vNGipa1lmaPBpr7VopywZaeewal5wGaqrpuTmsC0stSlZKyoop67tbHRaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsprint-interview-with-a-successful-sprinter.html&text=Interview%20with%20Leah%2c%20our%20successful%20Lingoda%20sprinter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsprint-interview-with-a-successful-sprinter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsprint-interview-with-a-successful-sprinter.html&title=Interview%20with%20Leah%2c%20our%20successful%20Lingoda%20sprinter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsprint-interview-with-a-successful-sprinter.html&title=Interview%20with%20Leah%2c%20our%20successful%20Lingoda%20sprinter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsprint-interview-with-a-successful-sprinter.html&title=Interview%20with%20Leah%2c%20our%20successful%20Lingoda%20sprinter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsprint-interview-with-a-successful-sprinter.html&description=Interview%20with%20Leah%2c%20our%20successful%20Lingoda%20sprinter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tokyo-olympics-ioc-ban-athlete-protests.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Majority of Likely U.S. Olympics Viewers Support IOCs Ban on Political Demonstration">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./business-finance-personnel-nov-4-1935.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Business &amp;amp; Finance: Personnel: Nov. 4, 1935">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
