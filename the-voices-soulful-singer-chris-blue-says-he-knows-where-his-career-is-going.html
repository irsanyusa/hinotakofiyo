Chris became the first winner of The Voice to only receive one chair turn during the blind auditions. What came next for this smooth operator?</strong></p><p>Chris’s blind audition of the Smokey Robinson song “Tracks Of My Tears” earned him the final spot on the show that season. The combination of his range and stage presence set Chris apart and garnered him adoring fans across the country.</p><p>A year after his win, Chris released his debut single, ‘Blue Blood Blues,’ to little fanfare. In 2019, he released his EP, “Fresh Start,” hoping to bring his adoring fans back long after Season 12 ended. Chris had to learn the hard way that winning a singing competition show will not place you in the upper echelon of pop culture automatically.</p><p>It was a surprise for Chris that his career did not skyrocket the way he had hoped after the show. This is the same man whose performance of Stevie Wonder’s song “Superstition” during the knockout round had enough views that the video charted on YouTube’s top trending videos.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chris-blue-has-big-plans-moving-into-2022>Chris Blue Has Big Plans Moving into 2022</h2><p>“It’s not an overnight thing. I realized that a lot is on me, and that was something I wasn’t ready for. After winning The Voice, I needed a team of people to do everything for me, and I wanted that,” Chris said in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2018 interview</a>. “Now, I want to make sure I’m involved in everything, and it’s taken time for me to get there, but now I’m here, and it’s beautiful. Again, just not what I expected.”</p><p>What made Chris’s win more outstanding was that Keys believed in him so much that she decided to <a href=#>act as his manager</a>. For Chris, what has taken time was actually figuring out what he wanted for his career and deciding to take control. His first order of business was splitting with <a href=#>Republic Records</a>, the record label that signs all of The Voice‘s Winners. Next, Chris took three months off to “discover” himself he said in a 2019 <a href=#>interview</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Chis’s plans for 2020 were halted as a result of the spread of Covid-19. Defying the odds, the singer was able to put out his single, ‘Back 2 The Future,’ which addresses the plight of the Black community.</p><p>Now, in 2021, with a newborn baby, Chris has his sights set on the future with his latest release, ‘The Chris Blue Project.’</p><p><br>The let down that Chris experienced for not skyrocketing to fame after the pure joy of winning over the hearts of millions of voting fans has not deterred him.</p><p>“I’m very happy and blessed to be where I am. We’re building with our new sound and new creative direction,” <a href=#>he said</a> about the next phase of his career. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Website-Thumbnail-7.jpeg alt="Holly Forbes Set to Tour With ‘AGT’ Winner Landau Eugene Murphy Jr." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmv4yspq6klqq5br%2FIp56eql2YtbO10maZpa2VYsCixdJmn55lm6O8uL%2BMsJ%2BeqpVitaq%2FjJyYq52Vp3qqv4ygpqKml2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-voices-soulful-singer-chris-blue-says-he-knows-where-his-career-is-going.html&text=%27The%20Voice%27s%20Soulful%20Singer%20Chris%20Blue%20Says%20He%20Knows%20Where%20His%20Career%20is%20Going&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-voices-soulful-singer-chris-blue-says-he-knows-where-his-career-is-going.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-voices-soulful-singer-chris-blue-says-he-knows-where-his-career-is-going.html&title=%27The%20Voice%27s%20Soulful%20Singer%20Chris%20Blue%20Says%20He%20Knows%20Where%20His%20Career%20is%20Going" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-voices-soulful-singer-chris-blue-says-he-knows-where-his-career-is-going.html&title=%27The%20Voice%27s%20Soulful%20Singer%20Chris%20Blue%20Says%20He%20Knows%20Where%20His%20Career%20is%20Going" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-voices-soulful-singer-chris-blue-says-he-knows-where-his-career-is-going.html&title=%27The%20Voice%27s%20Soulful%20Singer%20Chris%20Blue%20Says%20He%20Knows%20Where%20His%20Career%20is%20Going" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-voices-soulful-singer-chris-blue-says-he-knows-where-his-career-is-going.html&description=%27The%20Voice%27s%20Soulful%20Singer%20Chris%20Blue%20Says%20He%20Knows%20Where%20His%20Career%20is%20Going" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bonnaroo-lineup-2024-red-hot-chili-peppers-post-malone-fred-again-1235866163.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bonnaroo Unveils 2024 Lineup: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Post Malone and Fred Again Headline">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./xomg-pop.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="XOMG POP News, Videos &amp;amp; Updates">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
