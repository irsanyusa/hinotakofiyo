After acting as a coach for nearly 23 seasons, Shelton has proven himself as one of the most successful figures on the show. Shelton has mentored nine of The Voice winners to date. Let’s take a look at the members of Team Blake who won the show, and what they’re up to now.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Jermaine Paul</h2><p>Jermaine Paul emerged as Shelton’s first The Voice champion in Season Two, leaving an incredible mark with his powerful vocals and undeniable talent. Since his victory, Paul’s musical journey has taken a subdued path. He typically has occasional releases such as the singles “Working Sista” in 2015 and “Water” in 2019. Presently, he assumes the role of CEO at CJAS Music and continues to captivate audiences with his soulful performances from time to time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Cassadee Pope</h2><p>Cassadee Pope, the trailblazing winner of The Voice Season Three, shattered barriers as the first female champion. With her captivating voice and diverse musical background as the lead vocalist of the pop-punk band Hey Monday, Pope initially caught the attention of all four judges during her blind audition, ultimately choosing Team Blake.</p><p>Since her triumphant victory, Pope has been charting her own course in the music industry, departing from country music and returning to her pop-rock roots in her solo projects, exemplified by her collaboration with Levi Hummon on the song “RSVP.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Danielle Bradbery</h2><p>The remarkable winner The Voice Season Four, Danielle Bradbery, burst onto the scene at the tender age of 16, becoming the youngest champion in the history of the TV singing competition at the time. After claiming the crown, she signed with Big Machine Label Group and released two albums, garnering success with Top 40 country singles and touring alongside industry heavyweights like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miranda Lambert</a>, Thomas Rhett, and Brett Eldredge proving that she is just getting started in her musical journey.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Craig Wayne Boyd</h2><p>Country crooner, Craig Wayne Boyd, captured the hearts of the American public and emerged as the underdog winner of The Voice Season Seven. Following his victory, Boyd’s career took off as his first single, “My Baby’s Got a Smile on Her Face,” soared to number one on the country charts. Securing a recording deal and finding love soon after, Boyd’s journey continued with the release of his album Top Shelf in 2017. Although his collaboration with Texas Hill came to an end, Boyd remains devoted to his solo career, ready to enthrall audiences with his genuine country music.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Sundance Head</h2><p>Sundance Head, the talented country-soul singer, and Team Blake member made a resounding impact on The Voice Season 11. His win secured Blake Shelton’s record-breaking fifth victory as a coach. In current day, Sundance Head continues to perform live, including opening for the Zac Brown Band, and signed with Dean Dillon’s record label, leading to the release of his debut album Stained Glass and Neon in 2019. Head’s passion for music remains unwavering, as he embraces the joy of touring and sharing his music, whether in large venues or for intimate bar settings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Chloe Kohanski</h2><p>Chloe Kohanski, winner of The Voice Season 13, has continued to pursue her music career under the name <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sweet93</a>. After her victory in December 2017, she then signed with Republic Records and released her debut single, “Come This Far.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kohanski</a> has since been releasing music independently and exploring her rock-inspired sound.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Todd Tilghman</h2><p>After winning Season 18 of The Voice, Todd Tilghman, a pastor-turned-singer, has continued to pursue his music career. Despite the challenges of winning during the pandemic, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tilghman</a> made history as the oldest winner in The Voice‘s history at the age of 42. Since his victory, he has released several singles, including “Worth It All,” “Home Wasn’t Built In A Day,” and “Fall” in 2022, and “Dig My Grave” in 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Cam Anthony</h2><p>After winning Season 20 of The Voice, Cam Anthony, the talented singer from north Philadelphia, has been actively pursuing his music career. He continues to update his YouTube page with new music releases and also engages with his fans on Instagram. Anthony remains dedicated to honing his craft and sharing his incredible vocal abilities with the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Bryce Leatherwood</h2><p>Bryce Leatherwood, the winner of The Voice Season 22 and Shelton’s final champion on the show, continues to make strides in his country music career. Following his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">victory</a>, Leatherwood earned a $100,000 cash prize, and signed with Republic Records.
