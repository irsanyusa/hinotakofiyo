The girl gained enormous popularity, and her photos were all over the billboards of&nbsp;cinemas and on&nbsp;magazine covers.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> tried to&nbsp;figure out why this blonde girl became the symbol of&nbsp;the country and why she still remains irreplaceable.</p><p><h2>How a&nbsp;simple girl Norma became the iconic Marilyn</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4cc/f7d/6af2af5938bc87fc7b1926c6be.jpg><p>Before the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>start</a> of&nbsp;her career, the girl changed her look drastically. She had a&nbsp;clear understanding at&nbsp;that moment that a&nbsp;blonde girl with styled hair had more chance to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the cinema world.</p><p>It&nbsp;was when she already had her famous appearance that she signed her first contract with 20th Century Fox. Ben Lyon outlined right away that the surname of&nbsp;her husband, Dougherty, had too many possible pronunciations. So&nbsp;they started to&nbsp;think over a&nbsp;new nickname for her together. Norma offered to&nbsp;use the surname of&nbsp;her maternal line, while Lyon chose the name Marilyn because Norma resembled the star of&nbsp;the Broadway musical <i>Ziegfeld Follies, </i>Marilyn Miller, to&nbsp;him.</p><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her letters, the actress wrote that the nickname Clare Norman was also being considered as&nbsp;a&nbsp;screen name. It&nbsp;will take 10&nbsp;more years for her to&nbsp;officially change the name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/869/0dc/cdc0505ca0ad1ed1be5d87a621.jpg><p>But Marilyn Monroe is&nbsp;not only about a&nbsp;bright name. The actress’ <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>look</a> was shaped gradually. At&nbsp;first, the girl received only <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>small</a> roles, acting as&nbsp;a&nbsp;chic, luxurious woman. The audience liked this image, and Monroe’s popularity was growing.</p><p>Despite the fact she had plenty of&nbsp;offers to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;movies, Marilyn wanted to&nbsp;develop as&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional actress, so&nbsp;she was taking acting lessons. But it&nbsp;seems nothing of&nbsp;this made sense because the directors were only seeing an&nbsp;attractive doll in&nbsp;her. That’s why she started to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what she could do&nbsp;the best&nbsp;— portray beautiful women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dad/516/c9a7a55bada001cbaa5d24ea8c.jpg><p>The shot from <i>The Prince and the Showgirl </i>movie. It’s the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>only</a> flick with the participation of&nbsp;Monroe that was not shot in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>.</p><p>It’s worth noting that women didn’t like Monroe’s image. They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>considered</a> her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;too vulgar. However, Marilyn started a&nbsp;trend for dresses enhancing the curves of&nbsp;the body. She wasn’t feeling shy to&nbsp;choose outfits that were making her even more attractive and beautiful.</p><p><h2>Monroe had many “clones”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a89/24a/bcd97f59688a7ea7f8f5b0c489.jpg><p>Marilyn and Lana Turner.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, Monroe was not the first blonde girl who appeared on&nbsp;TV screens. For example, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lana Turner</a> started to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;filming before her. Both <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lana</a> and Marilyn couldn’t boast a&nbsp;happy childhood. In&nbsp;1951, Turner <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>got</a> the title of&nbsp;the most glamorous woman in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;world art.</p><p>Another bright blonde of&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe’s time is&nbsp;<a href=# title="Grace Kelly" data-link=tag>Grace Kelly</a>, who finished her career to&nbsp;become the wife of&nbsp;the Monaco prince. However, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rumors</a> say that the Prince was recommended to&nbsp;marry a&nbsp;Hollywood actress, and initially, he&nbsp;chose Marilyn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c1/4e6/0b396b500cb6c0b252948d2f6c.jpg><p>Marilyn and Grace Kelly.</p><p>After Monroe’s success in&nbsp;and outside Hollywood, blonde girls started to&nbsp;appear like mushrooms after the rain. Everyone wanted to&nbsp;repeat her success.</p><p>Jayne Mansfield, who also signed a&nbsp;contract with 20th Century Fox, was one of&nbsp;such actresses. The studio was planning to&nbsp;replace the naughty and demanding Monroe with the new blonde. Despite her outer resemblance, Mansfield <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>didn’t consider</a> herself to&nbsp;simply be&nbsp;“Marilyn’s clone.” She kept insisting that she and Monroe actually don’t look that much alike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b5c/c5b/297d0253ff8032f77b7413ed93.jpg><p>Marilyn and Jayne Mansfield</p><p>As&nbsp;curious as&nbsp;it&nbsp;might sound, another Hollywood blonde, Kim Novak, was also named Marilyn at&nbsp;birth. People <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remember</a> her by&nbsp;her main role in&nbsp;the Hitchcock classic <i>Vertigo</i>. Monroe and Novak looked alike not only by&nbsp;appearance, both of&nbsp;them had a&nbsp;difficult childhood and issues with their psyche.</p><p>The studio hired Novak to&nbsp;replace another popular actress, Rita Hayworth, who was getting extremely difficult to&nbsp;work with and who was no&nbsp;longer bringing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;significant income. The owners of&nbsp;the cinema studio were hoping that Kim would bring them as&nbsp;much money as&nbsp;Marilyn.</p><p>They tried to&nbsp;adjust her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;familiar to&nbsp;the viewers’ stereotype, but the girl turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;not that simple and was desperately confronting them, trying to&nbsp;keep her uniqueness. At&nbsp;first, she refused to&nbsp;change her name, then the studio demanded that the actress lose weight and make her hair even lighter. Having found the right wardrobe for her, Novak was turned into an&nbsp;ideal sample that was about to&nbsp;start bringing them mountains of&nbsp;gold. It&nbsp;did work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/060/0bc/9a735b51f384e3be36435e95ae.jpg><p>Marilyn and Kim Novak.</p><p>There were other actresses who looked like Marilyn, like two peas in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pod. Betty Grable was one of&nbsp;them. They acted in&nbsp;the movie <i>How To&nbsp;Marry A&nbsp;Millionaire</i> together.</p><p>There were rumors that Monroe and Grable didn’t get along well. Betty, whose popularity was going down, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was said</a> to&nbsp;envy Marilyn, who was supposed to&nbsp;become the new star of&nbsp;the studio. In&nbsp;fact, the actresses had a&nbsp;good relationship. They say that once, Grable told Marilyn that she had already gotten what she wanted and wished her good luck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/86d/e24/b637795bf9a4f2a3673aebd7b0.jpg><p>Marilyn and Betty Grable</p><p>Sheree North was another iconic blonde actress. She was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rumored</a> to&nbsp;have been hired by&nbsp;20th Century Fox only to&nbsp;frighten the naughty Marilyn Monroe. Not only was North as&nbsp;light-haired, but also matched Monroe’s parameters almost 100%. But unlike other actresses, Sheree wasn’t feeling shy about aging and was ok&nbsp;with playing the roles of&nbsp;more mature women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d4d/70d/d3a319572995330eb0482d8ea5.jpg><p>Marilyn and Sheree North</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mamie Van Doren</a> was also called Marilyn’s clone. The girl was working with a&nbsp;different studio, Universal, that was in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;Monroe’s analog. Mamie was dyed blonde, and they started to&nbsp;film her in&nbsp;roles of&nbsp;silly but attractive beauties. In&nbsp;her interviews, Mamie Van Doren said that movie studios simply didn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with her because they were used to&nbsp;working with male stars like Rock Hudson, Jeff Chandler, and Tony Curtis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b1c/f14/b2b43451b8b53e9ef27752fe6d.jpg><p>Marilyn and Mamie Van Doren</p><p>There was another diva on&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ocean</a>&nbsp;— Diana Dors&nbsp;— the British version of&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe. She was named this because of&nbsp;her incredible resemblance to&nbsp;Marilyn. When the movie <i>The Asphalt Jungle</i> came to&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK, journalists remarked that the actress who played the main role looked very much like Diana Dors.</p><p>In&nbsp;1956, Diana <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>went</a> overseas to&nbsp;conquer Hollywood and signed an&nbsp;agreement with the RKO film studio. But this plan failed, the company stopped the agreement with her because the movies with her participation failed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fdd/6ae/364f4a535c901dcd46f9f882f9.jpg><p>Marilyn and Diana Dors</p><p>Another actress whom the studio was planning to&nbsp;replace Marilyn with was Anita Ekberg. She was born and grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;Sweden. In&nbsp;1951, she visited the USA as&nbsp;a&nbsp;participant in&nbsp;the Miss Universe contest. And though the girl didn’t win&nbsp;it, she was noticed by&nbsp;the Universal studio.</p><p>In&nbsp;the mid-50s, the Paramount studio <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> to&nbsp;work with her, promoting and presenting her as&nbsp;“Paramount’s Marilyn Monroe.” Anita got world fame through her role in&nbsp;Federico Fellini’s<i> La&nbsp;Dolce Vita</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/421/e21/59a2c75110b8dfce5fdd3239fb.jpg><p>Marilyn and Anita Ekberg</p><p><h2>Today’s stars gladly copy Marilyn’s look.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f5/5cc/bd67475e6d99989fa4d331b284.jpg><p>Madonna and Christina Aguilera.</p><p>Marilyn left a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;classic looks after her that became the main elements in&nbsp;pop culture.
